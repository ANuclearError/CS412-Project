4.6 Arrays
An array is a special type of object that can hold an ordered
collection of elements. The type of the elements of the array is
called the base type of the array; the number of
elements it holds is a fixed attribute called its
length. (For a collection with a variable length,
see the discussion of Vector objects in Chapter 7, Basic Utility Classes.) Java supports arrays of all numeric and
reference types.
The basic syntax of arrays looks much like that of C or C++. We
create an array of a specified length and access the elements with the
special index operator, []. Unlike other
languages, however, arrays in Java are true, first-class objects, which
means they are real objects within the Java language. An array is
an instance of a special Java array class and has a corresponding type
in the type system. This means that to use an array, as with any other
object, we first declare a variable of the appropriate type and then
use the new operator to create an instance of it.
Array objects differ from other objects in Java in three respects: 
Java implicitly creates a special array class for us whenever we
declare an array type variable. It's not strictly necessary to know
about this process in order to use arrays, but it helps in
understanding their structure and their relationship to other objects
in Java.
Java lets us use the special [] operator to access
array elements, so that arrays look as we expect. We could implement
our own classes that act like arrays, but because Java doesn't have
user-defined operator overloading, we would have to settle for having
methods like get() and put()
instead of using the special [] notation.
Java provides a corresponding special form of the
new operator that lets us construct an instance of
an array and specify its length with the []
notation.
Array Types
An array type variable is denoted by a base type followed by empty brackets 
[]. Alternatively, Java accepts a C-style declaration, 
with the brackets placed after the array name. The following are equivalent: 
int [] arrayOfInts; 
int arrayOfInts []; 
In each case, arrayOfInts is declared as an array 
of integers. The size of the array is not yet an issue, because we are 
declaring only the array type variable. We have not yet created an actual 
instance of the array class, with its associated storage. It's not even 
possible to specify the length of an array as part of its type. 
An array of objects can be created in the same way: 
String [] someStrings; 
Button someButtons []; 
Array Creation and Initialization
Having declared an array type variable, we can now use the
new operator to create an instance of the
array. After the new operator, we specify the base
type of the array and its length, with a bracketed integer expression:
arrayOfInts = new int [42]; 
someStrings = new String [ number + 2 ]; 
We can, of course, combine the steps of declaring and allocating the
array:
double [] someNumbers = new double [20]; 
Component widgets [] = new Component [12]; 
 As in C, array indices start with
zero. Thus, the first element of someNumbers [] is
0 and the last element is
19. After creation, the array elements are
initialized to the default values for their type. For numeric types,
this means the elements are initially zero:
int [] grades = new int [30]; 
grades[0] = 99; 
grades[1] = 72; 
// grades[2] == 0 
The elements of an array of objects are references to the objects, not
actual instances of the objects. The default value of each element is
therefore null, until we assign instances of
appropriate objects:
String names [] = new String [4]; 
names [0] = new String(); 
names [1] = "Boofa"; 
names [2] = someObject.toString(); 
// names[3] == null 
This is an important distinction that can cause confusion. In many
other languages, the act of creating an array is the same as
allocating storage for its elements. In Java, an array of objects
actually contains only reference variables and those variables, have
the value null until they are assigned to real
objects.[5] 
 Figure 4.4 illustrates the
names array of the previous example:
[5] 
The analog in C or C++ would be an array of pointers to objects.
However, pointers in C or C++ are themselves two- or four-byte
values. Allocating an array of pointers is, in actuality, allocating
the storage for some number of those pointer objects. An array of
references is conceptually similar, although references are not
themselves objects. We can't manipulate references or parts of
references other than by assignment, and their storage requirements (or
lack thereof) are not part of the high-level language specification.
Figure 4.4: The names array
names is a variable of type
String[] (i.e., a string array). The
String[] object can be thought of as containing
four String type variables. We have assigned
String objects to the first three array
elements. The fourth has the default value null.
Java supports the C-style curly braces {}
construct for creating an array and initializing its elements when it
is declared:
int [] primes = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 7+4 };    // primes[2] == 3 
An array object of the proper type and length is implicitly created
and the values of the comma-separated list of expressions are assigned
to its elements.
We can use the {} syntax with an array of
objects.  In this case, each of the expressions must evaluate to an
object that can be assigned to a variable of the base type of the
array, or the value null.  Here are some examples:
String [] verbs = { "run", "jump", someWord.toString() }; 
Button [] controls = { stopButton, new Button("Forwards"),  
    new Button("Backwards") }; 
// all types are subtypes of Object 
Object [] objects = { stopButton, "A word", null }; 
You should create and initialize arrays in whatever manner is
appropriate for your application. The following are equivalent:
Button [] threeButtons = new Button [3]; 
Button [] threeButtons = { null, null, null }; 
Using Arrays
The size of an array object is available in the public variable
length:
char [] alphabet = new char [26]; 
int alphaLen = alphabet.length;             // alphaLen == 26 
 
String [] musketeers = { "one", "two", "three" }; 
int num = musketeers.length;                // num == 3 
length is the only accessible field of an array; it
is a variable, not a method.
Array access in Java is just like array access in C; you access
an element by putting an integer-valued expression between brackets
after the name of the array. The following example creates an array of
Button objects called keyPad and
then fills the array with Button objects:
Button [] keyPad = new Button [ 10 ]; 
for ( int i=0; i &lt; keyPad.length; i++ )      keyPad[ i ] = new Button( Integer.toString( i ) );
Attempting to access an element that is outside the range of the array
generates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  This
is a type of RuntimeException, so you can either
catch it and handle it yourself, or ignore it, as we already
discussed:
String [] states = new String [50]; 
 
try { 
    states[0] = "California"; 
    states[1] = "Oregon"; 
    ... 
    states[50] = "McDonald's Land";  // Error--array out of bounds 
}  
catch ( ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException err ) { 
    System.out.println( "Handled error: " + err.getMessage() ); 
} 
It's a common task to copy a range of elements from one array
into another. Java supplies the arraycopy() method
for this purpose; it's a utility method of the
System class:
System.arraycopy( source, sourceStart, destination, 
                  destStart, length ); 
The following example doubles the size of the names 
array from an earlier example: 
String [] tmpVar = new String [ 2 * names.length ]; 
System.arraycopy( names, 0, tmpVar, 0, names.length ); 
names = tmpVar; 
A new array, twice the size of names, is allocated
and assigned to a temporary variable tmpVar.
arraycopy() is used to copy the elements of
names to the new array. Finally, the new array is
assigned to names.  If there are no remaining
references to the old array object after names has
been copied, it will be garbage collected on the next pass.
Anonymous Arrays
You often want to create "throw-away" arrays: arrays that are only
used in one place, and never referenced anywhere else. Such arrays
don't need to have a name, because you never need to refer to them again
in that context.
For example, you may want to create a collection of objects to pass as
an argument to some method. It's easy enough to create a normal,
named array--but if you don't actually work with the array (if you use
the array only as a holder for some collection), you shouldn't have to.
Java makes it easy to create "anonymous" (i.e., unnamed) arrays. 
Let's say you need to call a method named
setPets(), which takes an array of
Animal objects as arguments.
Cat and Dog
are subclasses of Animal.  Here's how to
call setPets() using an anonymous array:
Dog pokey = new Dog ("gray");
Cat squiggles = new Cat ("black");
Cat jasmine = new Cat ("orange");
setPets ( new Animal [] { pokey, squiggles, jasmine });
The syntax looks just like the initialization of an array in a variable
declaration.  We implicitly define the size of the array and fill in its
elements using the curly brace notation.  However, since this is not a
variable declaration we have to explicitly use the new operator to create
the array object.
You can use anonymous arrays to simulate variable length argument lists
(often called VARARGS), a feature of many programming languages that
Java doesn't provide. The advantage of anonymous arrays over variable
length argument lists is that it allows stricter type checking; the
compiler always knows exactly what arguments are expected, and
therefore can verify that method calls are correct.
Multidimensional Arrays
Java supports multidimensional arrays in the form of arrays of array type 
objects. You create a multidimensional array with C-like syntax, using 
multiple bracket pairs, one for each dimension. You also use this syntax 
to access elements at various positions within the array. Here's 
an example of a multidimensional array that represents a chess board: 
ChessPiece [][] chessBoard; 
chessBoard = new ChessPiece [8][8]; 
chessBoard[0][0] = new ChessPiece( "Rook" ); 
chessBoard[1][0] = new ChessPiece( "Pawn" ); 
... 
Here chessBoard is declared as a variable of
type ChessPiece[][] (i.e., an array of
ChessPiece arrays).  This declaration implicitly
creates the type ChessPiece[] as well. The example
illustrates the special form of the new operator
used to create a multidimensional array. It creates an array of
ChessPiece[] objects and then, in turn, creates each
array of ChessPiece objects. We then index
chessBoard to specify values for particular
ChessPiece elements. (We'll neglect the color
of the pieces here.)
Of course, you can create arrays of with more than two
dimensions. Here's a slightly impractical example:
Color [][][] rgbCube = new Color [256][256][256]; 
rgbCube[0][0][0] = Color.black; 
rgbCube[255][255][0] = Color.yellow; 
... 
As in C, we can specify the initial index of a multidimensional array
to get an array type object with fewer dimensions. In our example, the
variable chessBoard is of type
ChessPiece[][].  The expression
chessBoard[0] is valid and refers to the first
element of chessBoard, which is of type
ChessPiece[]. For example, we can create a row for
our chess board:
ChessPiece [] startRow =  { 
    new ChessPiece("Rook"), new ChessPiece("Knight"), 
    new ChessPiece("Bishop"), new ChessPiece("King"), 
    new ChessPiece("Queen"), new ChessPiece("Bishop"), 
    new ChessPiece("Knight"), new ChessPiece("Rook") 
}; 
 
chessBoard[0] = startRow; 
We don't necessarily have to specify the
dimension sizes of a multidimensional array with a single
new operation. The syntax of the
new operator lets us leave the sizes of some
dimensions unspecified. The size of
at least the first dimension (the most significant dimension of the
array) has to be specified, but the sizes of any number of the less
significant array dimensions may be left undefined. We can assign
appropriate array type values later.
We can create a checkerboard of boolean
values (which is not quite sufficient for a real game of checkers)
using this technique:
boolean [][] checkerBoard; 
checkerBoard = new boolean [8][]; 
Here, checkerBoard is declared and created, but its
elements, the eight boolean[] objects of the next
level, are left empty. Thus, for example,
checkerBoard[0] is null until we
explicitly create an array and assign it, as follows:
checkerBoard[0] = new boolean [8]; 
checkerBoard[1] = new boolean [8]; 
... 
checkerBoard[7] = new boolean [8]; 
The code of the previous two examples is equivalent to: 
boolean [][] checkerBoard = new boolean [8][8]; 
One reason we might want to leave dimensions of an array unspecified is 
so that we can store arrays given to us by another method. 
Note that since the length of the array is not part of its type, the arrays 
in the checkerboard do not necessarily have to be of the same length. 
Here's a defective (but perfectly legal) checkerboard: 
checkerBoard[2] = new boolean [3]; 
checkerBoard[3] = new boolean [10]; 
Since Java implements multidimensional arrays as arrays of arrays,
multidimensional arrays do not have to be rectangular. For example,
here's how you could create and initialize a triangular array:
int []][] triangle = new int [5][]; 
for (int i = 0; i &lt; triangle.length; i++) {  
    triangle[i] = new int [i + 1]; 
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; i + 1; j++) 
        triangle[i][j] = i + j;    } 
Inside Arrays
I said earlier that arrays are instances of special array classes in
the Java language. If arrays have classes, where do they fit into the
class hierarchy and how are they related? These are good questions;
however, we need to talk more about the object-oriented aspects of
Java before I can answer them. For now, take it on faith that arrays
fit into the class hierarchy; details are in Chapter 5, Objects in Java.
