4.3 Types
The type system of a programming language describes how its data
elements (variables and constants) are associated with actual
storage. In a statically typed language, such as C or C++, the type of
a data element is a simple, unchanging attribute that often
corresponds directly to some underlying hardware phenomenon, like a
register value or a pointer indirection. In a more dynamic language
like Smalltalk or Lisp, variables can be assigned arbitrary elements
and can effectively change their type throughout their lifetime. A
considerable amount of overhead goes into validating what happens in
these languages at run-time. Scripting languages like Tcl and awk
achieve ease of use by providing drastically simplified type systems
in which only certain data elements can be stored in variables, and
values are unified into a common representation such as strings.
As I described in Chapter 1, Yet Another Language?, Java combines the
best features of both statically and dynamically typed languages. As
in a statically typed language, every variable and programming element
in Java has a type that is known at compile-time, so the interpreter
doesn't normally have to check the type validity of assignments while
the code is executing. Unlike C or C++ though, Java also maintains
run-time information about objects and uses this to allow safe
run-time polymorphism.
Java data types fall into two categories. Primitive
types represent simple values that have built-in
functionality in the language; they are fixed elements like literal
constants and numeric expressions. Reference
types (or class types) include objects and arrays; they are
called reference types because they are passed "by
reference" as I'll explain shortly.
Primitive Types
Numbers, characters, and boolean values are fundamental elements in Java. 
Unlike some other (perhaps more pure) object-oriented languages, they are 
not objects. For those situations where it's desirable to treat a primitive 
value as an object, Java provides "wrapper" classes 
(see Chapter 7, Basic Utility Classes). One major advantage of 
treating primitive values as such is that the Java compiler can more
readily optimize their usage. 
Another advantage of working with the Java virtual-machine
architecture is that primitive types are precisely defined. For
example, you never have to worry about the size of an
int on a particular platform; it's always a
32-bit, signed, two's complement number.  Table 4.2 summarizes Java's primitive types.
Table 4.2: Java Primitive Data Types
Type
Definition
boolean
true or false
char
16-bit Unicode character
byte
8-bit signed two's complement integer
short
16-bit signed two's complement integer
int
32-bit signed two's complement integer
long
64-bit signed two's complement integer
float
32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point value
double
64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point value
If you think the primitive types look like an idealization of C
scalar types on a byte-oriented 32-bit machine, you're
absolutely right.  That's how they're supposed to
look. The 16-bit characters were forced by Unicode, and generic pointers were
deleted for other reasons we'll touch on later, but in general
the syntax and semantics of Java primitive types are meant to fit a C
programmer's mental habits. If you're like most of this
book's readers, you'll probably find this saves you a lot
of mental effort in learning the language.
Declaration and initialization
Variables are declared inside of methods or classes in C style. For example: 
int foo; 
double d1, d2; 
boolean isFun; 
Variables can optionally be initialized with an appropriate expression 
when they are declared: 
int foo = 42; 
double d1 = 3.14, d2 = 2 * 3.14; 
boolean isFun = true; 
Variables that are declared as instance variables in a class are set to 
default values if they are not initialized. In this case, they act much 
like static variables in C or C++. Numeric types 
default to the appropriate flavor of zero, characters are set to the null 
character "\0," and boolean variables 
have the value false. Local variables declared 
in methods, on the other hand, must be explicitly initialized before they 
can be used. 
Integer literals
Integer literals can be specified in octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), 
or hexadecimal (base 16). A decimal integer is specified by a sequence 
of digits beginning with one of the characters 1-9: 
int i = 1230; 
Octal numbers are distinguished from decimal by a leading zero: 
int i = 01230;             // i = 664 decimal 
(An interesting, but meaningless, observation is that this would make the 
number 0 an octal value in the eyes of the compiler.) 
As in C, a hexadecimal number is denoted by the leading characters
0x or 0X (zero "x"), followed by
digits and the characters a-f or A-F, which represent the decimal
values 10-15 respectively:
int i = 0xFFFF;            // i = 65535 decimal 
Integer literals are of type int unless they are
suffixed with an L, denoting that they are to be
produced as a long value:
long l = 13L; 
long l = 13;               // equivalent--13 is converted from type int 
(The lowercase character l ("el") is also
acceptable, but should be avoided because it often looks like the
numeral 1).
When a numeric type is used in an assignment or an expression involving 
a type with a larger range, it can be promoted to the larger type. For 
example, in the second line of the above example, the number 13 has the 
default type of int, but it's promoted to type 
long for assignment to the long 
variable. Certain other numeric and comparison operations also cause this 
kind of arithmetic promotion. A numeric value can never be assigned to a type 
with a smaller range without an explicit (C-style) cast, however: 
int i = 13; 
byte b = i;                // Compile time error--explicit cast needed 
byte b = (byte) i;         // Okay 
Conversions from floating point to integer types always require an explicit 
cast because of the potential loss of precision. 
Floating-point literals
Floating-point values can be specified in decimal or scientific
notation.  Floating-point literals are of type
double unless they are suffixed with an
f denoting that they are to be
produced as a float value:
double d = 8.31; 
double e = 3.00e+8; 
float f = 8.31F; 
float g = 3.00e+8F; 
Character literals
A literal character value can be specified either as a single-quoted character 
or as an escaped ASCII or Unicode sequence: 
char a = 'a'; 
char newline = '\n'; 
char octalff = \u00ff; 
Reference Types
In C, you can make a new, complex data type by creating a
structure.  In Java (and other object-oriented
languages), you instead create a class that defines
a new type in the language. For instance, if we create a new class
called Foo in Java, we are also implicitly creating
a new type called Foo. The type of an item governs
how it's used and where it's assigned. An item of type
Foo can, in general, be assigned to a variable of
type Foo or passed as an argument to a method that
accepts a Foo value.
In an object-oriented language like Java, a type is not
necessarily just a simple attribute. Reference types are related in
the same way as the classes they represent. Classes exist in a
hierarchy, where a subclass is a specialized kind of its parent
class. The corresponding types have a similar relationship, where the
type of the child class is considered a subtype of the parent
class. Because child classes always extend their parents and have, at
a minimum, the same functionality, an object of the
child's type can be used in place of an object of the
parent's type. For example, if I create a new class,
Bar, that extends Foo, there is
a new type Bar that is considered a subtype of
Foo. Objects of type Bar can
then be used anywhere an object of type Foo
could be used; An object of type Bar is said to be
assignable to a variable of type Foo. This is
called subtype polymorphism and is one of the
primary features of an object-oriented language. We'll look more
closely at classes and objects in Chapter 5, Objects in Java.
Primitive types in Java are used and passed "by
value." In other words, when a primitive value is assigned or
passed as an argument to a method, it's simply copied. Reference
types, on the other hand, are always accessed "by
reference." A reference is simply a handle
or a name for an object. What a variable of a reference type
holds is a reference to an object of its type (or of a subtype).  A
reference is like a pointer in C or C++, except that its type is
strictly enforced and the reference value itself is a primitive entity
that can't be examined directly. A reference value can't be created
or changed other than through assignment to an appropriate
object. When references are assigned or passed to methods, they are
copied by value. You can think of a reference as a pointer type that
is automatically dereferenced whenever it's mentioned.
Let's run through an example. We specify a variable of
type Foo, called myFoo, and
assign it an appropriate object:
Foo myFoo = new Foo(); 
Foo anotherFoo = myFoo; 
myFoo is a reference type variable that holds a
reference to the newly constructed Foo object.  For
now, don't worry about the details of creating an object;
we'll cover that in Chapter 5, Objects in Java. We designate a
second Foo type variable,
anotherFoo, and assign it to the same object. There are
now two identical references: myFoo and
anotherFoo. If we change things in the state of
the Foo object itself, we will see the same 
effect by looking at it with
either reference. The comparable code in C++ would be:
// C++ 
Foo&amp; myFoo = *(new Foo()); 
Foo&amp; anotherFoo = myFoo; 
We can pass one of the variables to a method, as in: 
myMethod( myFoo ); 
An important, but sometimes confusing distinction to make at this
point is that the reference itself is passed by value. That is, the
argument passed to the method (a local variable from the method's
point of view) is actually a third copy of the reference.  The method
can alter the state of the Foo object itself
through that reference, but it can't change the caller's reference to
myFoo.  That is, the method can't change the
caller's myFoo to point to a different Foo object.
For the times we want a method to change a reference for us, we have
to pass a reference to the object that contains it, as shown in 
Chapter 5, Objects in Java.
Reference types always point to objects, and objects are always
defined by classes. However, there are two special kinds of reference
types that specify the type of object they point to in a slightly
different way. Arrays in Java have a special place in the type
system. They are a special kind of object automatically created to
hold a number of some other type of object, known as the base
type. Declaring an array-type reference implicitly creates the new
class type, as you'll see in the next section.
Interfaces are a bit sneakier. An interface defines a set of methods
and a corresponding type. Any object that implements all methods of
the interface can be treated as an object of that type. Variables and
method arguments can be declared to be of interface types, just like
class types, and any object that implements the interface can be
assigned to them. This allows Java to cross the lines of the class
hierarchy in a type safe way, as you'll see in Chapter 5, Objects in Java.
A Word About Strings
Strings in Java are objects; they are therefore a reference
type. String objects do, however, have some special
help from the Java compiler that makes them look more
primitive. Literal string values in Java source code are turned into
String objects by the compiler.  They can be used
directly, passed as arguments to methods, or assigned to
String type variables:
System.out.println( "Hello World..." ); 
String s = "I am the walrus..."; 
String t = "John said: \"I am the walrus...\""; 
The + symbol in Java is overloaded to provide
string concatenation; this is the only overloaded operator in Java:
String quote = "Four score and " + "seven years ago,"; 
String more = quote + " our" + " fathers" +  " brought..."; 
Java builds a single String object from the concatenated 
strings and provides it as the result of the expression. We will discuss 
the String class in Chapter 7, Basic Utility Classes.
