12.6 Nonstandard Layout Managers
We've covered the basic layout managers; with them, you should
be able to create just about any user interface you like. 
But that's not all, folks. If you want to experiment with
layout managers that are undocumented, may change, and may not be
available locally on all platforms, look in the 
sun.awt
classes. You'll find a HorizBagLayout, a
VerticalBagLayout, an
OrientableFlowLayout, and a
VariableGridLayout. Furthermore, public-domain
layout managers of all descriptions are beginning to appear on the
Net; keep your eye on Gamelan and the other Java archives.
