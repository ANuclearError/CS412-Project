13.4 Images
So far, we've worked with methods for drawing simple shapes and
displaying text. For more complex graphics, we'll be working
with images. AWT has a powerful set of tools for
generating and displaying image data that address the problems
of working in a distributed and multithreaded application
environment. We'll start with the basics of the
java.awt.Image class and see how to get an image
into an Applet and draw it on a display. This job
isn't quite as simple as it sounds; the browser might have to
retrieve the image from a networked source when we ask for
it. Fortunately, if we're just interested in getting the image on the
screen whenever it's ready, we can let AWT handle
the details for us. Later in this chapter, we'll discuss how to
manage image loading ourselves, as well as how to create raw image
data and feed it efficiently to the rest of an application.
The Image Class
The java.awt.Image class represents a view of an
image. The view is created from an image source that produces pixel
data. Images can be from a static source, such as
GIF or JPEG data, or a dynamic
one, such as a video stream or a graphics engine. The
Image class in Java 1.1 also handles
GIF89a animations.
An applet can ask its viewer to retrieve an image by calling
the getImage() method. The location of the image to
be retrieved is given as a URL, either absolute or
fetched from the applet's resources:
public class MyApplet extends java.applet.Applet { 
    public void init() { 
        try { 
            // absolute URL 
            URL monaURL = new URL(
                "http://myserver/images/mona_lisa.gif"); 
            Image monaImage = getImage( monaURL ); 
 
            // applet resource URL 
            URL daffyURL = getClass().getResource("cartoons/images/daffy.gif"); 
            Image daffyDuckImage = getImage( daffyURL );
        }  
        catch ( MalformedURLException e ) { // unintelligable url } 
We usually want to package an applet's images with the applet itself,
so the second form, using getResource(), is
preferred; it looks for the image in the applet's JAR file (if there
is one), before looking elsewhere in the server's file system.  See
Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities (I/O) for more about loading class resources.
Once we have an Image object, we can draw it into
a graphics context with the drawImage() method of
the Graphics class. The simplest form of
drawImage() takes four parameters: the
Image object, the x,
y coordinates at which to draw it, and a reference
to a special image observer object.
Image Observers
Images in AWT are processed asynchronously, which
means Java performs image operations like loading and scaling on its
own time. For example, the getImage() method always
returns immediately, even if the image data has to be retrieved over
the network from Mars and isn't available yet. In fact, if it's
a new image, Java won't even begin to fetch it until we try to
use it. The advantage of this technique is that Java can do the work
of a powerful, multithreaded image-processing environment for
us. However, it also introduces several problems. If Java is loading
an image for us, how do we know when it's completely loaded? What if
we want to work with the image as it arrives? What if we need to know
properties of the image (like its dimensions) before we can start
working with it? What if there's an error in loading the image?
These problems are handled by image observers--designated
objects that implement the ImageObserver
interface. All operations that draw or examine
Image objects return immediately, but they take an
image-observer object as a parameter. The
ImageObserver monitors the image's status and
can make that information available to the rest of the
application. When image data is loaded from its source, an image
observer is notified of its progress, including when new pixels
are available, when a complete frame of the image is ready, and if
there is an error during loading. The image observer also receives
attribute information about the image, such as its dimensions and
properties, as soon as they are known.
The drawImage() method, like other image
operations, takes a reference to an ImageObserver
object as a parameter. drawImage() returns a
boolean value specifying whether or not the image
was painted in its entirety. If the image data has not yet been
loaded or is only partially available, drawImage()
paints whatever fraction of the image it can and returns. The
image-observer object, however, is registered as being interested
in information about the image. It's then called repeatedly as more
pixel information is available and again when the entire image is
complete. The image observer can do whatever it wants with this
information. Most often it calls repaint() to
prompt the applet to draw the image again with the updated data; as
you should recall, a call to repaint() initiates a
call to paint() to be scheduled. In this way an
applet can redraw the image as it arrives, for a progressive loading
effect.  Alternatively, it could wait until the entire image is loaded 
before displaying it.
We'll discuss creating image observers a bit later. For
now, we can avoid the issue by using a prefabricated image
observer. It just so happens that the Component
class implements the ImageObserver interface and
provides some simple repainting behavior for us. This means that every
component can serve as its own default image observer; we simply pass
a reference to our applet (or other component) as the image-observer
parameter of a drawImage() call. Hence the
mysterious this we've occasionally seen
when working with graphics:
class MyApplet extends java.applet.Applet { 
    ... 
    public void paint( Graphics g ) { 
        drawImage( monaImage, x, y, this ); 
        ... 
Our applet serves as the image observer and calls
repaint() for us to redraw the image as
necessary. If the image arrives slowly, our applet is notified
repeatedly, as new chunks become available. As a result, the image
appears gradually, as it's loaded. 
The awt.image.incrementaldraw and
awt.image.redrawrate system properties control
this behavior. redrawrate limits how often
repaint() is called; the default value is every 100
milliseconds. incrementaldraw prevents drawing
until the entire image has arrived. By default, this property is set
to "true"; set it to "false" to turn off
incremental redrawing.
Scaling and Size
Another version of drawImage() renders a scaled 
version of the image: 
drawImage( monaImage, x, y, x2, y2, this ); 
This draws the entire image within the rectangle formed by the points
x, y and x2,
y2, scaling as necessary. (Cool, eh?)
drawImage() behaves the same as before; the image
is processed by the component as it arrives and the image observer is
notified as more pixel data and the completed image are available.
Several other overloaded versions of drawImage()
provide more complex options: you can scale, crop, and perform some
simple transpositions.
If you want to actually make a scaled copy of an image (as opposed to
simply painting one at draw time), you can call
getScaledInstance(). Here's how:
Image scaledDaffy =
    daffyImage.getScaledInstance(100,200,SCALE_AREA_AVERAGING);
This method scales the original image to the given size; in this case,
100 by 200 pixels. It returns a new Image that you
can draw like any other image. SCALE_AREA_AVERAGING
is a constant that tells getScaledImage() what
scaling algorithm to use. The algorithm used here tries to do a decent
job of scaling, at the expense of time. Some alternatives that take
less time are SCALE_REPLICATE, which scales by
replicating scan lines and columns (which is fast, but probably not
pretty).  You can also specify either SCALE_FAST,
or SCALE_SMOOTH and let the implementation choose
an appropriate algorithm that optimizes for time or quality.  If you
don't have specific requirements, you should use
SCALE_DEFAULT which, ideally, would be set by a
preference in the user's environment.
Scaling an image before calling
drawImage() can improve performance, because the
image loading and scaling can take place before the image is actually
needed. Of course, the same amount of work takes place, but in most
situations, prescaling will make the program appear faster because it
takes place while other things are going on; the user doesn't have to
wait as long for the image to display.  
The Image getHeight() and
getWidth() methods retrieves the dimensions of an
image. Since this information may not be available until the
image data is completely loaded, both methods also take an
ImageObserver object as a parameter. If the
dimensions aren't yet available, they return values of
-1 and notify the observer when the true value
is known. We'll see how to
deal with these and other problems a bit later. For now, we'll
use Component as an image observer to get by, and
move on to some general painting techniques.
