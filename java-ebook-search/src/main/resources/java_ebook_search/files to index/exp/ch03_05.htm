3.5 The Applet Tag
    Add stuff about 'archive' tag.
Applets are embedded in HTML documents with the
&lt;applet&gt; tag. The
&lt;applet&gt; tag resembles the
HTML &lt;img&gt; image
tag.[2]
 It contains attributes that identify the
applet to be displayed and, optionally, give the Web browser hints
about how it should be displayed. The standard image tag sizing and
alignment attributes, such as height and
width, can be used inside the applet tag. Unlike
images, however, applets have both an opening
&lt;applet&gt; and a closing
&lt;/applet&gt; tag. Sandwiched between these can be
any number of &lt;param&gt; tags that contain
application-specific parameters to be passed to the applet itself:
[2] 
If you are not familiar with HTML or other
markup languages, you may want to refer to HTML: The
Definitive Guide, from O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for a
complete reference on HTML and structured Web
documents.
&lt;applet attribute [ attribute ] ...  &gt; 
[&lt;param parameter &gt;] 
[&lt;param parameter &gt;] 
... 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
Attributes
Attributes are name/value pairs that are interpreted by a Web browser
or applet viewer. (Many HTML tags besides
&lt;applet&gt; have attributes.) Attributes of the
&lt;applet&gt; tag specify general features that
apply to all applets, such as size and alignment. The definition of
the &lt;applet&gt; tag lists a fixed set of
recognized attributes; specifying an incorrect or 
nonexistent
attribute should be considered an HTML error.
Three attributes, code,
width, and height, are always
required in the &lt;applet&gt;
tag. code specifies the name of the applet to be
loaded; width and height
determine its initial size. Other attributes are optional.
The following is an HTML fragment for a
hypothetical, simple clock applet that takes no parameters and
requires no special HTML layout:
&lt;applet code=AnalogClock width=100 height=100&gt;&lt;/applet&gt; 
The HTML file that contains this
&lt;applet&gt; tag needs to be stored in the same
directory as the AnalogClock.class class file. The
applet tag is not sensitive to spacing, so the above is therefore
equivalent to:
&lt;applet 
    code=AnalogClock 
    width=100 
    height=100&gt; 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
You can use whatever form seems appropriate. 
Parameters
Parameters are analogous to command-line arguments; they provide a way 
to pass information to an applet. Each &lt;param&gt; 
tag contains a name and a value that are passed as strings to the applet: 
&lt;param name = parameter_name value = parameter_value&gt; 
Parameters provide a means of embedding application-specific data and
configuration information within an HTML
document.[3]
 Our AnalogClock applet, for example, might accept
a parameter that selects between local and universal time:
[3] 
If you are wondering why the applet's parameters are specified
in yet another type of tag, here's the reason. In the original
alpha release of Java, applet parameters were included inside of a
single &lt;app&gt; tag along with formatting
attributes. However, this format was not
SGML-compliant, so the
&lt;param&gt; tag was added.
&lt;applet code=AnalogClock width=100 height=100&gt; 
    &lt;param name=zone value=GMT&gt; 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
Presumably, this AnalogClock applet is designed to
look for a parameter named zone with a possible
value of GMT.
Parameter names and values can be quoted to contain spaces and
other special characters. We could therefore be more verbose
and use a parameter value like the following:
&lt;param name=zone value="Greenwich Mean Time"&gt; 
The parameters a given applet expects are determined by the developer
of that applet. There is no fixed set of parameter names or
values; it's up to the applet to interpret the parameter name/value
pairs that are passed to it. Any number of parameters can be specified,
and the applet may choose to use or ignore them as it sees fit. The
applet might also consider parameters to be either optional or
required and act accordingly.
Hablo Applet?
Web browsers ignore tags they don't understand; if the Web
browser doesn't interpret the &lt;applet&gt; or
&lt;param&gt; tags, they should disappear and any
HTML between the
&lt;applet&gt;and &lt;/applet&gt;
tags should appear normally.
By convention, Java-enabled Web browsers do the opposite and
ignore any extra HTML between the
&lt;applet&gt; and
&lt;/applet&gt; tags. This means we can place
some alternate HTML inside the
&lt;applet&gt; tag, which is then displayed only by
Web browsers that can't run the applet.
For our AnalogClock example, we could
display a small text explanation and an image of the clock applet as a
teaser:
&lt;applet code=AnalogClock width=100 height=100&gt; 
    &lt;param name=zone value=GMT&gt; 
    &lt;strong&gt;If you see this you don't have a Java-enabled Web 
    browser. Here's a picture of what you are missing.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;\applet&gt; 
The Complete Applet Tag
We can now spell out the full-blown &lt;applet&gt; 
tag:[4]
[4] 
The HTML working group of the
IETF is investigating standardization of embedded
objects in HTML. A draft document can be found at
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-cda-00.txt.
They would prefer a slightly less application-centric name such as
&lt;embed&gt;. However, their discussion, for the
most part, parallels the &lt;applet&gt; tag.
&lt;applet 
    code = class name 
    width = pixels wide 
    height = pixels high 
    [ codebase = location URL ] 
    [ name = instance name ] 
    [ alt = alternate text ] 
    [ align = alignment style ] 
    [ vspace = vertical pad pixels ] 
    [ hspace = horizontal pad pixels ] 
&gt; 
[ &lt;param name = parameter name value = parameter value&gt; ] 
[ &lt;param name = parameter name value = parameter value&gt; ] 
... 
[ HTML for non Java aware browsers ] 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
The width, height, 
align, vspace, and 
hspace attributes have the same meanings as those 
of the &lt;img&gt; tag and determine the preferred 
size, alignment, and padding respectively. 
The alt attribute specifies alternate text that is
displayed by browsers that understand the
&lt;applet&gt; tag and its attributes, but
can't actually run applets. This attribute can also
describe the applet, since in this case any alternate
HTML between &lt;applet&gt; and
&lt;\applet&gt; is ignored.
The name attribute specifies an instance
name for the executing applet. This is a name specified as
a unique label for each copy of an applet on a particular
HTML page. For example, if we include our
clock twice on the same page (using two applet tags), we could give
each instance a unique name to differentiate them:
&lt;applet code=AnalogClock name="bigClock" width=300 height=300&gt;&lt;\applet&gt; 
&lt;applet code=AnalogClock name="smallClock" width=50 height=50&gt;&lt;\applet&gt; 
Applets use instance names to recognize and communicate with other
applets on the same page. We could, for instance, create a
"clock setter" applet that knows how to set the time on a
AnalogClock applet and pass it the instance name of
a particular target clock on this page as a parameter. This might look
something like:
&lt;applet code=ClockSetter&gt; 
    &lt;param name=clockToSet value="bigClock"&gt; 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
Loading Class Files
The code attribute of the
&lt;applet&gt; tag should specify the name of an
applet. This is either a simple class name, or a package path and class
name. For now, let's look at simple class names; I'll
discuss packages in a moment. By default, the Java run-time system
looks for the class file in the same location as the
HTML document that contains it. This location is
known as the base URL for the document.
Consider an HTML document,
clock.html, that contains our clock applet
example:
&lt;applet code=AnalogClock width=100 height=100&gt;&lt;\applet&gt; 
Let's say we retrieve the document at the following
URL:
http://www.time.ch/documents/clock.html
Java tries to retrieve the applet class file from the same base
location:
http://www.time.ch/documents/AnalogClock.class
The codebase attribute of the
&lt;applet&gt; tag can be used to specify an
alternative base URL for the class file search.
Let's say our HTML document now
specifies codebase, as in the following example:
&lt;applet 
    codebase=http://www.joes.ch/stuff/ 
    code=AnalogClock 
    width=100 
    height=100&gt; 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
Java now looks for the applet class file at: 
http://www.joes.ch/stuff/AnalogClock.class
Packages
Packages are groups of Java classes; see Chapter 5, Objects in Java for
more information. A package name is a little like an Internet
hostname, in that they both use a hierarchical, dot-separated naming
convention. A Java class file can be identified by its full name by
prefixing the class name with the package name. We might therefore
have a package called time for time-related Java
classes, and perhaps a subordinate package called
time.clock to hold classes related to one or more
clock applications.
In addition to providing a naming scheme, packages can be used
to locate classes stored at a particular location. Before a class file
is retrieved from a server, its package-name component is translated
by the client into a relative path name under the base
URL of the document. The components of a class
package name are simply turned into the components of a path name,
just like with classes on your local system.
Let's suppose that our AnalogClock has 
been placed into the time.clock package and now 
has the fully qualified name of time.clock.AnalogClock. 
Our simple &lt;applet&gt; tag would now look 
like: 
&lt;applet code=time.clock.AnalogClock width=100 height=100&gt;&lt;\applet&gt; 
Let's say the clock.html document is 
once again retrieved from: 
http://www.time.ch/documents/clock.html
Java now looks for the class file in the following location: 
http://www.time.ch/documents/time/clock/AnalogClock.class
The same is true when specifying an alternative
codebase:
&lt;applet 
    codebase=http://www.joes.ch/stuff/ 
    code=time.clock.AnalogClock 
    width=100 
    height=100&gt; 
&lt;\applet&gt; 
Java now tries to find the class in the corresponding path under the
new base URL:
http://www.joes.ch/stuff/time/clock/AnalogClock.class
One possible package-naming convention proposes that Internet host and
domain names be incorporated as part of package names to form a unique
identifier for classes produced by a given organization. If a company
with the domain name foobar.com produced our
AnalogClock class, they might distribute it in a
package called com.foobar.time.clock. The fully
qualified name of the AnalogClock class would then
be com.foo.time.clock.AnalogClock. This would
presumably be a unique name stored on an arbitrary server. A future
version of the Java class loader might use this to automatically
search for classes on remote hosts.
Perhaps soon we'll run Sun's latest
and greatest Web browser directly from its source with:
% java com.sun.java.hotjava.HotJava
Viewing Applets
Sun's JDK comes with an applet-viewer program
aptly called appletviewer. To use
appletviewer, specify the URL
of the document on the command line. For example, to view our
AnalogClock at the URL shown
above, use the following command:
% appletviewer http://www.time.ch/documents/clock.html 
The appletviewer retrieves all applets in the
specified document and displays each one in a separate
window. appletviewer is not a Web browser; it
doesn't attempt to display HTML. It's primarily a
convenience for testing and debugging applets.  If the document
doesn't contain &lt;applet&gt; tags,
appletviewer does nothing.
