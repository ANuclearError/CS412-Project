5.9 Inner Classes
We've left out something important in our discussion of Java classes
so far: a large and relatively recent heap of syntactic sugar called
inner classes.  Simply put, classes in Java can
be declared at any level of scope.  That is, you can declare a class
within any set of curly braces (that is, almost anywhere that you
could put any other Java statement) and its visibility is limited to
that scope in the same way that the name of a variable or method would
be.  Inner classes are a powerful and aesthetically pleasing facility
for structuring code.[7]
Their even sweeter cousins,
anonymous inner classes, are another powerful
shorthand that make it seem like you can create classes dynamically
within Java's statically typed environment.
[7] 
The implementation of Java's inner classes draws on experience from the 
language Beta, and other block structured languages such as Pascal,
and Scheme.
However, if you delve into the inner workings of Java, inner classes
are not quite as aesthetically pleasing or dynamic.  We said that they
are syntactic sugar; by this we mean that they let you leverage the
compiler by writing a few lines of code that trigger a lot of
behind-the-scenes work somewhere between the compiler's front end and
the byte-code.  Inner classes rely on code-generation; they are a
feature of the Java language, but not of the Java virtual machine.  As
a programmer you may never need be aware of this; you can simply rely
on inner classes like any other language construct.  However, you
should know a little about how inner classes work, to better
understand the results and a few potential side effects.
To this point, all of our classes have been top level classes.
We have declared them, free standing, at the package level. Inner
classes are essentially nested classes, like this:
    Class Animal {
        Class Brain { 
            ...
        }
    }
Here the class Brain is an inner class: it
is a class declared inside the scope of class
Animal.  Although the details of what that
means require a fair bit of explanation, we'll start by saying that
the Java language tries to make the meaning, as much as possible, the
same as for the other Java entities (methods and variables) living at
that level of scope.  For example, let's add a method to the
Animal class:
    Class Animal {
        Class Brain { 
            ...
        }
        void performBehavior() { ... }
    }
Both the inner class Brain and the method
performBehavior() are within the scope of
Animal.  Therefore, anywhere within
Animal we can refer to Brain and
performBehavior() directly, by name.  Within
Animal we can call the constructor for
Brain (new Brain()) to get a
Brain object, or invoke
performBehavior() to carry out that method's
function.  But neither Brain nor
performBehavior() are accessible outside of the
class Animal without some additional qualification.
Within the body of the Brain class and the
body of the performBehavior() method, we
have direct access to all of the 
other methods and variables of the Animal
class.  So, just as
the performBehavior() method could work
with the Brain class and create
instances of Brain, code within the
Brain class can invoke the
performBehavior() method of
Animal as well as work with any other
methods and variables declared in Animal.
That last bit has important consequences.  From within 
Brain we can invoke the method
performBehavior(); that is--from within
an
instance of Brain we can invoke the
performBehavior() method of an instance 
of Animal.  Well, which instance of
Animal?   If we have several 
Animal objects around (say, a few
Cats and
Dogs), we need to know whose
performBehavior() method we are calling.
What does it mean for a class
definition to be "inside" another class definition?
The answer is that a Brain object 
always lives within a single instance of
Animal: the one that it was
told about when it was created.  We'll call the object that contains
any instance of Brain its enclosing
instance.
A Brain object cannot live outside of an
enclosing instance of an
Animal object.  Anywhere you see an
instance of Brain, it will be tethered 
to an instance of Animal.
Although it is possible to construct a
Brain object from 
elsewhere (i.e., another class), Brain
always requires an enclosing instance of
Animal to "hold" it.  We'll also say now
that if Brain is to be referred to
from outside of Animal it acts something
like an Animal.Brain class.  And
just as with the performBehavior() method,
modifiers can be applied to
restrict its visibility.  There is even an interpretation of the
static modifier, which we'll talk about a
bit later.  However, the details
are somewhat boring and not immediately useful, so you should consult
a full language reference for more info (like O'Reilly's Java
Language Reference, Second Edition).
So before we get too far afield, let's turn to a more compelling example.
A particularly important use of inner classes is to make 
adapter classes.  An adapter class is a "helper" class
that ties one class to another in a very specific way.  Using adapter classes
you can write your classes more naturally, without having to
anticipate 
every conceivable user's needs in advance.  Instead, you provide
adapter classes that
marry your class to a particular interface.   
As an example, let's say that we have an
EmployeeList object: 
public class EmployeeList {
    private Employee [] employees = ... ;
    ...
}
EmployeeList holds information about a set
of employees, representing some view of our database. Let's say that we
would like to have EmployeeList provide
its elements as an enumeration (see Chapter 7, Basic Utility Classes).  An enumeration is a
simple interface to a set of objects that looks like this:
// the java.util.Enumeration interface
public interface Enumeration {
    boolean hasMoreElements();
    Object nextElement();
}
It lets us iterate through its elements, asking for the next one and 
testing to see if more remain.  The enumeration is a good candidate for
an adapter class because it is an interface that our
EmployeeList can't readily implement
itself.  That's because an enumeration
is a "one way", disposable view of our data.  It isn't intended to be 
reset and used again, and therefore should be kept separate from the
EmployeeList itself.  This is crying out
for a simple class to provide 
the enumeration capability.  But what should that class
look like?
Well, before we knew about inner classes, our only recourse would have been
to make a new "top level" class.  We would probably feel obliged to call it
EmployeeListEnumeration:
class EmployeeListEnumeration implements Enumeration {
    // lots of knowledge about EmployeeList
    ...
}
Here we have a comment representing the machinery that the 
EmployeeListEnumeration requires.  Think
for just a second about what you'd
have to do to implement that machinery. The resulting class would be
completely coupled to the EmployeeList,
and unusable in other situations. Worse, to function it must have 
access to the inner workings of
EmployeeList.  We would have to allow
EmployeeListEnumeration access to the
private array in EmployeeList, exposing
this data more widely than it should be. This is less than ideal.
  
This sounds like a job for inner classes. We already said that
EmployeeListEnumeration was useless
without the EmployeeList; this sounds a
lot like the "lives inside" relationship we described earlier.
Furthermore, an inner class lets us avoid the encapsulation problem,
because it can access all the members of its enclosing instance.
Therefore, if we use an inner class to implement the enumeration, 
the array employees can remain
private, invisible outside the
EmployeeList. So let's just shove that 
helper class inside the scope of our
EmployeeList: 
public class EmployeeList {
    private Employee [] employees = ... ;
    
    // ...
    
    class Enumerator implements java.util.Enumeration {
        int element = 0;
        boolean hasMoreElements() {
            return  element &lt; employees.length ;
        }
        Object nextElement() {
            if ( hasMoreElements() )
                return employees[ element++ ];
            else 
                throw NoSuchElementException();
        }
    }
    
}
Now EmployeeList can provide an accessor
method like the following to let other classes work with the list:
    ...
    Enumeration getEnumeration() {
        return new Enumerator();
    }
One effect of the move is that we are free to be a little more familiar in 
the naming of our enumeration class.  Since it is no longer a top
level class, we can give it a name that is only appropriate within the
EmployeeList. In this case, we've
named it Enumerator to emphasize what it
does--but we don't need a name like
EmployeeEnumerator that shows the
relationship to the EmployeeList class,
because that's implicit. We've also filled
in the guts of the Enumerator class.  As
you can see, now that it is inside 
the scope of EmployeeList,
Enumerator has 
direct 
access to its private members, 
so it can directly access the employees
array.  This greatly simplifies 
the code and maintains the compile-time safety. 
Before we move on, we should note that inner classes can have
constructors, even though we didn't need one in this example.  They
are in all respects real classes.
Inner Classes within methods
Inner classes may also be declared withing the body of a method.
Returning to the Animal class, we could
put Brain inside the
performBehavior() method if we decided
that the class was only useful inside of that method.
    Class Animal {
        void performBehavior() { 
            Class Brain { 
                ...
            }
        }
    }
In this situation, the rules governing what
Brain can see are the same as in our
earlier example. 
The body of Brain can see anything in 
the scope of performBehavior() and, of
course, above it.  This includes
local variables of performBehavior(), and
its arguments. This raises a few questions.  
performBehavior() is a method, and methods
have limited lifetimes.  When they
exit their local variables normally disappear into the stacky abyss.  But an 
instance of Brain (like any object)
lives on as long as it is referenced.
So Java makes sure that any local variables used by instances of
Brain 
created within an invocation of
performBehavior() also live on.
Furthermore, 
all of the instances of Brain that we make
within a single invocation of
performBehavior() will see the same local
variables.
Static Inner Classes
We mentioned earlier that the inner class
Brain of the class
Animal could in
some ways be considered an Animal.Brain class.
That is, it is possible to work with a
Brain from outside the
Animal class,
using just such a qualified name:
Animal.Brain.  But given that our
Animal.Brain class always requires an
instance of an Animal as 
its enclosing instance, some explicit setup is needed.[8]
[8] 
Specifically, we would have to follow a design pattern and pass a reference 
to the enclosing instance of Animal into
the Animal.Brain constructor. See a
language reference for more information. We don't expect you to run
into this situation very often.
But there is another situation where we might use inner classes by name.
An inner class that lives within the body of a top level class 
(not within a method or another inner class) can be declared
static.
For example:
    class Animal  {
        static class MigrationPattern { 
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
 
A static inner class such as this acts just like a new top
level class called Animal.MigrationPattern; we can
use it without regard to any enclosing instances. Although this seems
strange, it is not inconsistent since a static member never has an
object instance associated with it. The requirement that the inner
class be defined directly inside a top level class ensures that an
enclosing instance won't be needed.  If we have permission, we can
create an instance of the class using the qualified name:
    Animal.MigrationPattern stlToSanFrancisco = new Animal.MigrationPattern();
As you see, the effect is that Animal acts
something like a mini-package, holding the
MigrationPattern class. We can use all of the
standard visibility modifiers on inner classes, so a static inner
class could be private, protected, default, or publicly visible.
Anonymous Inner Classes
Now we get to the best part.  
As a general rule, the more deeply encapsulated and limited in scope 
our classes are, the more freedom we have in naming them.   We saw this
in our enumeration example.  This is not just a purely aesthetic issue.  
Naming is an important part of writing readable and maintainable 
code.   We generally want to give things the most concise and meaningful
names possible.  A corollary to this is that we prefer to avoid doling out
names for purely ephemeral objects that are only going to be used once.
Anonymous inner classes are an extension of the syntax of the 
new operation. When you create an
anonymous inner class, you combine the class's declaration
with the allocation of an instance of that class (much like the way 
you can declare a variable of the type of an un-named structure in C).
After the new
operator, you specify either the name of a class or an interface, followed
by a class body.  The class body becomes an inner class, which either extends
the specified class or, in the case of an interface, is expected to implement 
the specified interface.  A single instance of the class is created and 
returned as the value.
For example, we could do away with the declaration of the
Enumerator class in the
EmployeeList example by
using an anonymous 
inner class in the getEnumeration() method:
    ...
        
    Enumeration getEnumeration() {
    
        return new Enumeration() {
            int element = 0;
            boolean hasMoreElements() {
                return  element &lt; employees.length ;
            }
            Object nextElement() {
                if ( hasMoreElements() )
                    return employees[ element++ ];
                else 
                    throw NoSuchElementException();
            }
        };
    }
    
Here we have simply moved the guts of Enumerator
into the body of an anonymous inner class.  The call to
new implicitly constructs the class and returns an
instance of the class as its result.  Note the extent of the curly
braces, and the semi-colon at the end.  It is a single statement.
But the code above certainly does not improve readability.  Inner classes
are best used when you want to implement a few lines of code,
where the verbiage and conspicuousness of declaring a separate class detracts
from the task at hand.  Here's a better example:  Suppose that we want to 
start a new thread to execute the
performBehavior() method of our
Animal:
    new Thread ( new Runnable() {
        public void run() {  performBehavior();  }
    } ).start();
Here we have gone over to the terse side.  We've allocated and started
a new Thread, providing an anonymous inner
class that implements the Runnable
interface by calling our performBehavior()
method. The effect is similar to using a method pointer in some other
language; the inner class effectively substitutes the method we want
called (performBehavior()) for 
the method the system
wants to call (run()). However, the inner
class allows the compiler to check type consistency, which would be
difficult (if not impossible) with a true method pointer. At the same
time, our anonymous adapter class with its three lines of code is much
more efficient and readable than creating a new, top level adapter
class named AnimalBehaviorThreadAdapter.
While we're getting a bit ahead of the story, anonymous adapter
classes are a perfect fit for event handling (which we'll cover fully
in Chapter 10, Understand the Abstract Windowing Toolkit). Skipping a lot of explanation, let's say you want the
method handleClicks() to be called
whenever the user clicks the mouse. You would write code like this:
addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { handleClicks(e); }
});
In this case, the anonymous class extends the AWT's
MouseAdapter class, by overriding its
mouseClicked() method to call our method.
A lot is going on in a very small space, but the result is clean,
readable code. You get to assign method names that are meaningful to
you, while allowing Java to do its job of type checking. 
this and scoping
Sometimes an inner class may want to get a handle on its "parent" enclosing
instance.  It might want to pass a reference to its parent, or to
refer to one of the parent's variables or methods that has been hidden
by one of its own. For example:
        class Animal {
            int size;
            class Brain {
                int size;
            }
        }
Here, as far as Brain is concerned, the
variable size in
Animal is hidden by its own version.
Normally an object refers to itself using the special
this reference (implicitly or explicitly).
But what is the meaning of this for an
object with one or more enclosing instances?  The answer is that an
inner class has multiple this references.
You can specify which this you want by
prepending the name of the class.
So, for instance (no pun intended), we can get a reference to our
Animal from within
Brain like so:
        ...
        class Brain {
            Animal ourAnimal = Animal.this;
            ...
Similarly, we could refer to the size variable in
Animal:
        ...
        class Brain {
            int animalSize = Animal.this.size;
            ...
How do inner classes really work?
Finally, we'll get our hands dirty and take a look at what's really going
on when we use an inner class.  We've said that the compiler is doing all 
of the things that we had hoped to forget about.  Let's see what's actually
happening. Try compiling our simple example:
    class Animal {
        class Brain {
        }
    }
(Oh, come on, do it...)
What you'll find is that the compiler generates two .class files:
Animal.class
Animal$Brain.class
The second file is the class file for our inner class.  Yes, as we feared, 
inner classes are really just compiler magic.  The compiler has created
the inner class for us as a normal, top level class and named it by combining
the class names with a dollar sign.  The dollar sign is a valid
character in class names, but is intended for use only by automated tools
in this way.  (Please don't start naming your classes with dollar signs).
Had our class been more deeply nested, the intervening inner class names
would have been attached in the same way to generate a unique top level name.
Now take a look at it using the javap utility:
    # javap 'Animal$Brain'
    class Animal$Brain extends java.lang.Object 
    {
        Animal$Brain(Animal);
    }
You'll see that the compiler has given our inner class a constructor that
takes a reference to an Animal as an
argument.  This is how the real inner 
class gets the handle on its enclosing instance.  
The worst thing about these additional class files is that you need to
know they are there. Utilities like jar don't automatically
find them; when you are invoking a utility like jar, you need
to specify these files explicitly, or use a wild 
card that finds them. 
Security Implications
Given what we just saw above--that the inner class really does exist as an
automatically generated top level class--how does it get access to 
private variables?  The answer, unfortunately, is that the compiler is 
forced to break the encapsulation of your object and insert accessor methods
so that the inner class can reach them.  The accessor methods will be given
package level access, so your object is still safe within its package walls,
but it is conceivable that this difference could be meaningful if people
were allowed to create new classes within your package.
The visibility modifiers on inner classes also have some problems.  Current
implementations of the virtual machine do not implement the notion of a 
private or protected class within a package, so giving your inner class
anything other than public or default visibility is only a compile-time
guarantee.
It is difficult to conceive of how these security issues could be
abused, but it is interesting to note that Java is straining a bit
to stay within its original design.
