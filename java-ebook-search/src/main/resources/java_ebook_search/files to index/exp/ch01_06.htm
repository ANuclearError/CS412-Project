1.6 Application and User Level Security
There's a fine line between having enough power to do something
useful and having all the power to do anything you want. Java provides
the foundation for a secure environment in which untrusted code can be
quarantined, managed, and safely executed. However, unless you are
content with keeping that code in a little black box and running it
just for its own benefit, you will have to grant it access to at least
some system resources so that it can be useful. Every kind of
access carries with it certain risks and benefits. The advantages of
granting an untrusted applet access to your windowing system, for
example, are that it can display information and let you interact in a
useful way. The associated risks are that the applet may instead
display something worthless, annoying, or offensive.  Since most people can
accept that level of risk, graphical applets and the World Wide
Web in general are possible.
At one extreme, the simple act of running an application gives
it a resource, computation time, that it may put to good use or burn
frivolously. It's difficult to prevent an untrusted application
from wasting your time, or even attempting a "denial of
service" attack.  At the other extreme, a powerful, trusted
application may justifiably deserve access to all sorts of system
resources (e.g., the filesystem, process creation, network
interfaces); a malicious application could wreak havoc with these
resources. The message here is that important and sometimes complex
security issues have to be addressed.
In some situations, it may be acceptable to simply ask the user
to "OK" requests. Sun's HotJava Web browser can pop
up a dialog box and ask the user's permission for an applet to
access an otherwise restricted file. However, we can put only so much
burden on our users. An experienced person will quickly grow tired of
answering questions; an inexperienced user may not even be able to
answer the questions. Is it okay for me to grant an applet access to
something if I don't understand what that is?
Making decisions about what is dangerous and what is not can be
difficult.  Even ostensibly harmless access, like displaying a window
can become a threat when paired with the ability for an untrusted
application to communicate off of your host. The Java
SecurityManager provides an option to flag windows
created by an untrusted application with a special, recognizable
border to prevent it from impersonating another application and
perhaps tricking you into revealing your password or your secret
recipe collection. There is also a grey area, in which an application
can do devious things that aren't quite destructive. An applet
that can mail a bug report can also mail-bomb your boss. The Java
language provides the tools to implement whatever security policies
you want. However, what these policies will be ultimately depends on
who you are, what you are doing, and where you are doing it.
To fully exploit the power of Java, we need to have some basis
on which to make reasonable decisions about the level of trust an
application should have. Web browsers such as HotJava start by
defining a few rules and some coarse levels of security that restrict
where applets may come from and what system resources they may
access. These rules are sufficient to keep the waving Duke applet from
clutching your password file, but they aren't sufficient for
applications you'd like to trust with sensitive
information. What if you want to implement a secure applet to carry a
credit card number to the mall, or more likely the credit-card
company? How are people to trust that the applet they are using is
really secure? If it's named the "Bank of Boofa" applet,
how do they know it's legit?
You might think of trusting only certain hosts for these kinds
of applications.  However, as Java class files begin to fill the Net,
the situation will become more complicated. Hosts can be
impersonated. If your communications pass through an untrusted
network, you can't be sure you're talking to the intended
entity. Furthermore, class files may need to be cached or retrieved
through complicated distribution mechanisms.  For these kinds of
applications, what we really need is a mechanism for verifying the
authorship and authenticity of an item and making sure that it has not
been tampered with by the time that you received it. Fortunately, this
is a problem solved a while ago by your friendly neighborhood
cryptographers.
Signing Classes
Digital signatures provide a means of authenticating documents. Like
their inky analogs, they associate a name with an item in a way that
is supposed to be difficult to forge. Unlike pen on paper, though,
electronic digital signatures are actually difficult to forge when
used properly. By their nature, digital signatures also provide the
benefit that, if authenticated, a document is known not to have been
altered in transit. In other words, you can't clip out a digital
signature and attach it to a new document.
The details of cryptography are a bit beyond the scope of this book but 
the basics are important and interesting.[6]
 Digital signatures are one side of the coin of public-key
cryptography. Public-key algorithms rely on the fundamental
mathematical difficulty of factoring arbitrarily large numbers. In a
public-key system, there are two pieces of information: a public key
(as you might have guessed) and a private one. These keys have a
special asymmetric relationship such that a message encrypted with one
key can be decrypted only by knowing the other. This means that by
giving you my public key, you can send me messages that only I can
read.  No one else, including you, has enough information to decrypt
the encoded message, so it's safe to send it over untrusted
networks. Now, by reversing this process, I can encrypt something with
my private key so that anyone can use my public key to read the
message. The important thing in this case is that the task of creating
such a message without the private key is just as difficult as
decoding the message in the first scenario. Since no one else knows my
private key, only the real me could have sent the message. This is the
basis for digital signatures. For Java, this means that we can tell a
browser "I trust applets signed by John Doe"; if the browser succeeds
in decoding an applet using John Doe's public key, it knows that the
applet really came from John Doe, and therefore can be allowed greater
privileges.

Cryptography (John Wiley &amp; Sons).
This process can be used to authenticate Java
class files and other types of objects sent over the network. The
author of a class signs the code with a digital signature, and we
authenticate it when we retrieve it. Now we know that we have the
authentic class, or do we? There is one problem that a digital
signature alone doesn't solve: at some point we still have to
assume we have the author's authentic public key. This is
where a key-certification agency comes into play.
A key-certification agency validates a key by issuing a
certificate that lists a name and an official public key. The
certificate is signed with the agency's own digital
signature. The agency presumably has a well-known public key to verify
the certificate. Of course, this doesn't solve the problem
entirely, but it reduces the number of people you have to trust and
the amount of information you have to transport reliably. Presumably
the agency is a reputable organization, its private keys are well
guarded, and it certifies keys only after some kind of real-world
validation such as person-to-person contact.
The most recent Java release (1.1) contains the tools you need to work with
signed classes. You can sign Java classes; you
can tell the HotJava browser whose classes you trust (and how much you
trust them). Other browsers,
like Netscape Navigator, should support signed classes in the future.
You can also use the security API in your own Java programs to handle
sensitive data safely. The important thing
is, as always, to know who you are dealing with and what kind of
software and security you have in place before sending any kind of
confidential information over the Net. Don't become paranoid,
just keep yourself informed so that you can weigh the risks and the
benefits.
