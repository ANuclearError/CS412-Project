9.2 Datagram Sockets
TinyHttpd used a Socket to
create a connection to the client using the TCP
protocol. In that example, TCP itself took care of
data integrity; we didn't have to worry about data arriving out
of order or incorrect. Now we'll take a walk on the wild
side. We'll build an applet that uses a
java.net.DatagramSocket, which uses the
UDP protocol. A datagram is sort of like a
"data telegram": it's a discrete chunk of data transmitted
in one packet. Unlike the previous example, where we could get a
convenient OutputStream from our
Socket and write the data as if writing to
a file, with a DatagramSocket we have to work one
datagram at a time. (Of course, the TCP protocol was
taking our OutputStream and slicing the data into
packets, but we didn't have to worry about those details).
UDP doesn't guarantee that the data
will get through. If the data do get through, it may not arrive in
the right order; it's even possible for duplicate datagrams to
arrive. Using UDP is something like cutting the
pages out of the encyclopedia, putting them into separate envelopes,
and mailing them to your friend. If your friend wants to read the
encyclopedia, it's his or her job to put the pages in order. If
some pages got lost in the mail, your friend has to send you a letter
asking for replacements.
Obviously, you wouldn't use UDP to
send a huge amount of data. But it's significantly more efficient
than TCP, particularly if you don't care
about the order in which messages arrive, or whether the data arrive
at all. For example, in a database lookup, the client can send a
query; the server's response itself constitutes an
acknowledgment. If the response doesn't arrive within a
certain time, the client can send another query. It shouldn't be
hard for the client to match responses to its original queries. Some
important applications that use UDP are the Domain
Name System (DNS) and Sun's Network
Filesystem (NFS).
The HeartBeat Applet
In this section we'll build a simple applet,
HeartBeat, that sends a datagram to its server each
time it's started and stopped. (See Chapter 10, Understand the Abstract Windowing Toolkit for a
complete discussion of the Applet class.)
We'll also build a simple standalone server application,
Pulse, that receives that datagrams and prints
them. By tracking the output, you could have a crude measure of who is
currently looking at your Web page at any given time. This is an ideal
application for UDP: we don't want the
overhead of a TCP socket, and if datagrams get
lost, it's no big deal.
First, the HeartBeat applet: 
import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 
 
public class HeartBeat extends java.applet.Applet { 
    String myHost; 
    int myPort; 
 
    public void init() { 
        myHost = getCodeBase().getHost(); 
        myPort = Integer.parseInt( getParameter("myPort") ); 
    } 
 
    private void sendMessage( String message ) { 
        try { 
            byte [] data = new byte [ message.length() ]; 
            message.getBytes(0, data.length, data, 0); 
            InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName( myHost ); 
            DatagramPacket pack = 
               new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, addr, myPort); 
 
            DatagramSocket ds = new DatagramSocket(); 
            ds.send( pack ); 
            ds.close(); 
        }  
        catch ( IOException e )    
            System.out.println( e ); 
    } 
 
    public void start() { 
        sendMessage("Arrived"); 
    } 
    public void stop() { 
        sendMessage("Departed"); 
    } 
} 
Compile the applet and include it in an HTML
document with an &lt;applet&gt; tag:
&lt;applet height=10 width=10 code=HeartBeat&gt;  
    &lt;param name="myPort" value="1234"&gt; 
&lt;/applet&gt; 
The myPort parameter should specify the port 
number on which our server application listens for data. 
Next, the server-side application, Pulse: 
import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 
 
public class Pulse { 
    public static void main( String [] argv ) throws IOException { 
 
        DatagramSocket s = 
           new DatagramSocket(Integer.parseInt(argv[0])); 
        while ( true ) { 
            DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(new byte
                                                      [1024], 1024); 
            s.receive( packet ); 
            String message = new String(packet.getData(), 0, 0, 
                                        packet.getLength()); 
            System.out.println( "Heartbeat from: " +  
                packet.getAddress().getHostName() + " - " + message ); 
        } 
    } 
} 
Compile Pulse and run it on your Web server, 
specifying a port number as an argument: 
% java Pulse 1234
The port number should be the same as the one you used in the
myPort parameter of the
&lt;applet&gt; tag for
HeartBeat.
Now, pull up the Web page in your browser. You won't see
anything there (a better application might do something visual as
well), but you should get a blip from the Pulse
application. Leave the page and return to it a few times. Each time
the applet is started or stopped, it sends a message:
Heartbeat from: foo.bar.com - Arrived 
Heartbeat from: foo.bar.com - Departed 
Heartbeat from: foo.bar.com - Arrived 
Heartbeat from: foo.bar.com - Departed 
... 
Cool, eh? Just remember the datagrams are not guaranteed to arrive 
(although it's unlikely you'll see them fail), and it's possible 
that you could miss an arrival or a departure. Now let's look at 
the code. 
HeartBeat
HeartBeat overrides the init(),
start(), and stop() methods of
the Applet class, and implements one private method
of its own, sendMessage(), that sends a
datagram. HeartBeat begins its life in
init(), where it determines the destination for its
messages. 
It uses the
Applet getCodeBase() and
getHost() methods to find the name of its
originating host and fetches the correct port number from the
myPort parameter of the HTML
tag. After init() has finished, the
start() and stop() methods are
called whenever the applet is started or stopped. These methods merely
call sendMessage() with the appropriate message.
sendMessage() is responsible for sending a
String message to the server as a datagram. It
takes the text as an argument, constructs a datagram packet containing
the message, and then sends the datagram. All of the datagram
information, including the destination and port number, are packed
into a java.net.DatagramPacket object. The
DatagramPacket is like an addressed envelope,
stuffed with our bytes. After the DatagramPacket is
created, sendMessage() simply has to open a
DatagramSocket and send it.
The first four lines of sendMessage() build the 
DatagramPacket: 
try { 
    byte [] data = new byte [ message.length() ]; 
    message.getBytes(0, data.length, data, 0); 
    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName( myHost ); 
    DatagramPacket pack = 
       new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, addr, myPort ); 
First, the contents of message are placed into an
array of bytes called data. Next a
java.net.InetAddress object is created from the
name myHost. An InetAddress
simply holds the network address information for a host in a special
format. We get an InetAddress object for our host
by using the static getByName() method of the
InetAddress class. (We can't construct an
InetAddress object directly.) Finally, we call the
DatagramPacket constructor with four arguments: the
byte array containing our data, the length of the data, the
destination address object, and the port number.
The remaining lines construct a default client
DatagramSocket and call its
send() method to transmit the
DatagramPacket; after sending the datagram, we
close the socket:
DatagramSocket ds = new DatagramSocket(); 
ds.send( pack ); 
ds.close(); 
Two operations throw a type of IOException: the
InetAddress.getByName() lookup and the
DatagramSocket
send(). InetAddress.getByName()
can throw an UnknownHostException, which is a type
of IOException that indicates that the host name
can't be resolved. If send() throws an
IOException, it implies a serious client side
problem in talking to the network. We need to catch these exceptions;
our catch block simply prints a message telling us
that something went wrong. If we get one of these exceptions, we can
assume the datagram never arrived. However, we can't assume the
converse. Even if we don't get an exception, we still
don't know that the host is actually accessible or that the data
actually arrived; with a DatagramSocket, we never
find out.
Pulse
The Pulse server corresponds to the
HeartBeat applet. First, it creates a
DatagramSocket to listen on our prearranged
port. This time, we specify a port number in the constructor; we get
the port number from the command line as a string
(argv[0]) and convert it to an integer with
Integer.parseInt(). Note the difference between
this call to the constructor and the call in
HeartBeat. In the server, we need to listen for
incoming datagrams on a prearranged port, so we need to specify the
port when creating the DatagramSocket. In the
client, we need only to send datagrams, so we don't have to
specify the port in advance; we build the port number into the
DatagramPacket itself.
Second, Pulse creates an empty
DatagramPacket of a fixed size to receive an
incoming datagram. This alternative constructor for
DatagramPacket takes a byte array and a length as
arguments. As much data as possible is stored in the byte array when
it's received. (A practical limit on the size of a
UDP datagram is 8K.)  Finally,
Pulse calls the
DatagramSocket's receive()
method to wait for a packet to arrive. When a packet arrives, its
contents are printed.
As you can see, working with DatagramSocket
is slightly more tedious than working with
Sockets. With datagrams, it's harder to spackle
over the messiness of the socket interface. However, the Java
API rather slavishly follows the
UNIX interface, and that doesn't help. I
don't see any reason why we have to prepare a datagram to hand
to receive() (at least for the current
functionality); receive() ought to
create an appropriate object on its own and hand it to us, saving us
the effort of building the datagram in advance and unpacking the data
from it afterwards. It's easy to imagine other conveniences; perhaps
we'll have them in a future release.
