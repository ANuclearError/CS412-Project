Acknowledgments
I wish to acknowledge the patience of my wife, Ginni, and my daughters,
Rachel, Shana, and Sossa, during the long hours I spent writing this
book.
I also want to thank Mike Loukides and Andy Cohen for their valuable
suggestions on the content of this book. I particularly want to thank
Paula Ferguson, who spent many long hours above and beyond the call
of duty poring over the details of this book to edit it into its
final form.
Thanks also to the staff at O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
Nicole Gipson Arigo was the production editor and project manager.
Kismet McDonough-Chan proofread the book. Ellie Fountain Maden and
Sheryl Avruch performed quality control checks. Seth Maislin wrote the
index. Erik Ray, Ellen Siever, and Lenny Muellner worked with the tools
to create the book. Robert Romano fine-tuned the figures. Nancy Priest
designed the interior book layout, and Edie Freedman designed the front cover.
