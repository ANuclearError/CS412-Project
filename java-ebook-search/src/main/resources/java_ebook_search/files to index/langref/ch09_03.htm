9.3 Generating Exceptions
A Java program can use the exception-handling mechanism to
deal with program-specific errors in a clean manner. A program simply
uses the throw statement to signal an exception.
The throw statement must be followed by an object
that is of type Throwable or one of its subclasses.
For program-defined exceptions, you typically want an exception object
to be an instance of a subclass of the Exception
class. In most cases, it makes sense to define a new subclass of
Exception that is specific to your program.
Consider the following example:
class WrongDayException extends Exception {
    public WrongDayException () {}
    public WrongDayException(String msg) {
        super(msg);
    }
}
public class ThrowExample {
    void doIt() throws WrongDayException{
        int dayOfWeek =(new java.util.Date()).getDay();
        if (dayOfWeek != 2  &amp;&amp; dayOfWeek != 4)
            throw new WrongDayException("Tue. or Thur.");
        // The rest of doIt's logic goes here
        System.out.println("Did it");
    }
    public static void main (String [] argv) {
        try {
            (new ThrowExample()).doIt();
        } catch (WrongDayException e) {
            System.out.println("Sorry, can do it only on "
                                + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
The code in this example defines a class called
WrongDayException
to represent the specific type of exception thrown by the example.
The Throwable class, and most subclasses of
Throwable,
have at least two constructors. One constructor takes a string argument
that is used as a textual message that explains the exception,
while the other constructor takes no arguments. Thus, the
WrongDayException class defines two constructors.
In the class ThrowExample, if the current
day of the week is neither Tuesday nor Thursday,
the doIt()
method throws a WrongDayException. Note that
the WrongDayException object is created at the
same time it is thrown. It is common practice to provide some
information about an exception when it is thrown, so a string argument
is used in the allocation statement for the
WrongDayException.
The method declaration for the doIt() method
contains a throws clause, to indicate the fact
that it can throw a WrongDayException.
The main() method in ThrowExample
encloses its call to the doIt() method in a
try
statement, so that it can catch any WrongDayException
thrown by doIt(). The catch
block prints an error message, using the getMessage()
method of the exception object. This method retrieves the string
that was passed to the constructor when the exception object was
created.

Printing Stack Traces
When an exception is caught, it can be useful to print a stack
trace to figure out where the exception came from. A stack trace
looks like the following:
java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at t.cap(t.java:16)
        at t.doit(t.java:8)
        at t.main(t.java:3)
You can print a stack trace by calling the
printStackTrace()
method that all Throwable objects inherit from
the Throwable class. For example:
int cap (x) {return 100/x}
try {
    cap(0);
} catch(ArithmeticException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
You can also print a stack trace anywhere in an application,
without actually throwing an exception. For example:
new Throwable().printStackTrace();

Rethrowing Exceptions
After an exception is caught, it can be rethrown if
is appropriate. The one choice that you have to make when rethrowing
an exception concerns the location from where the stack trace says the
object was thrown. You can make the rethrown exception appear
to have been thrown from the location of the original exception
throw, or from the location of the current rethrow.
To rethrow an exception and have the stack trace indicate
the original location, all you have to do is rethrow the exception:
try {
    cap(0);
} catch(ArithmeticException e) {
    throw e;
}
To arrange for the stack trace to show the actual location
from which the exception is being rethrown, you have to call the
exception's fillInStackTrace() method. This method
sets the stack trace information in the exception based on the current
execution context. Here's an example using the
fillIn-StackTrace() method:
try {
    cap(0);
} catch(ArithmeticException e) {
    throw (ArithmeticException)e.fillInStackTrace();
}
It is important to call fillInStackTrace() on
the same line as the throw statement, so that
the line number specified in the stack trace matches the line on
which the throw statement appears. The
fillInStackTrace()
method returns a reference to the Throwable class,
so you need to cast the reference to the actual type of the exception.
