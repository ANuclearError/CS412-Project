Compiler
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.lang.Compiler
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The Compiler class encapsulates a facility
for compiling Java classes to native code. As provided by Sun, the
methods of this class do not actually do anything. However, if the
system property java.compiler has been defined and
if the method System.loadLibrary() is able to
load the library named by the property, the methods of this class
use the implementations provided in the library.
The Compiler class has no public
constructors, so it cannot be instantiated.
Class Summary
public final class java.lang.Compiler extends java.lang.Object {
    // Class Methods
    public static native Object command(Object any);
    public static native boolean compileClass(Class clazz);
    public static native boolean compileClasses(String string);
    public static native void disable();
    public static native void enable();
}
Class Methods
command
public static native Object command(Object any)
Parameters
any
The permissible value and its meaning is determined
by the compiler library.
Returns
A value determined by the compiler library, or null
if no compiler library is loaded.
Description
This method directs the compiler to perform an operation specified
by the given argument. The available operations, if any, are determined
by the compiler library.
compileClass
public static native boolean compileClass(Class clazz)
Parameters
clazz
The class to be compiled to native code.
Returns
true if the compilation succeeds,
or false
if the compilation fails or no compiler library is loaded.
Description
This method requests the compiler to compile the specified
class to native code.
compileClasses
public static native boolean compileClasses(String string)
Parameters
string
A string that specifies the names of the classes
to be compiled.
Returns
true if the compilation succeeds
or false if the compilation fails
or no compiler library is loaded.
Description
This method requests the compiler to compile all of the classes
named in the string.
disable
public static native void disable()
