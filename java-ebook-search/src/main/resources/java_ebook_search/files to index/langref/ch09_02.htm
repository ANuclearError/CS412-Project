9.2 Declaring Exceptions
If a method is expected to throw any exceptions, the method
declaration must declare that fact in a throws
clause. If a method implementation contains a throw
statement, it is possible that an exception will be thrown
from within the method. In addition, if a method calls another method
declared with a throws clause, there is the possibility
that an exception will be thrown from within the method. If the
exception is not caught inside the method with a try
statement, it will be thrown out of the method to its caller. Any
exception that can be thrown out of a method in this way must be
listed in a throws clause in the method declaration.
The classes listed in a throws clause must be
Throwable or
any of its subclasses; the Throwable class is
the superclass of all objects that can be thrown in Java.
However, there are certain types of exceptions that do not
have to be listed in a throws clause. Specifically,
if the exception is an instance of Error,
RuntimeException,
or a subclass of one of those classes, it does not have to be listed
in a throws clause. Subclasses
of the Error
class correspond to situations that are not easily predicted,
such as the system running out of memory. Subclasses
of RuntimeException
correspond to many common run-time problems, such as illegal casts
and array index problems. The reason that these types of exceptions
are treated specially is that they can be thrown from such a large
number of places that essentially every method would have to declare
them.
Consider the following example:
import java.io.IOException;
class throwsExample {
    char[] a;
    int position;
    ...
    // Method explicitly throws an exception
    int read() throws IOException {
        if (position &gt;= a.length)
            throw new IOException();
        return a[position++];
    }
    // Method implicitly throws an exception
    String readUpTo(char terminator) throws IOException {
        StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer();
        while (true) {
            int c = read(); // Can throw IOException
            if (c == -1 || c == terminator) {
                return s.toString();
            }
            s.append((char)c);
        }
        return s.toString();
    }
    // Method catches an exception internally
    int getLength() {
        String s;
        try {
            s = readUpTo(':');
        } catch (IOException e) {
            return 0;
        }
        return s.length();
    }
    // Method can throw a RuntimeException
    int getAvgLength() {
        int count = 0;
        int total = 0;
        int len;
        while (true){
            len = getLength();
            if (len == 0)
                break;
            count++;
            total += len;
        }
        return total/count; // Can throw ArithmeticException
    }
}
The method read() can throw an
IOException,
so it declares that fact in its throws clause.
Without that throws clause, the compiler would
complain that the method must either declare IOException
in its throws clause or catch it. Although the
readUpTo() method does not explicitly throw any
exceptions, it calls the read() method that does
throw an IOException, so it declares that fact
in its throws clause. Whether explicitly or implicitly
thrown, the requirement to catch or declare an exception is the
same. The getLength() method catches the
IOException thrown by readUpTo(),
so it does not have to declare the exception. The final method,
getAvgLength(), can throw an
ArithmeticException if count
is zero. Because ArithmeticException is a subclass
of RuntimeException, the fact that it can be
thrown out of getAvgLength() does not need to be declared in a throws clause.
