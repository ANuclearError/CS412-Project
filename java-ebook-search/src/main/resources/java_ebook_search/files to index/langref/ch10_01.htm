The package java.lang contains classes and interfaces that
are essential to the Java language. These include:
Object, the ultimate superclass of
all classes in Java
Thread, the class that controls
each thread in a multithreaded program
Throwable, the superclass of all error and exception
classes in Java
Classes that encapsulate the primitive data types
in Java
Classes for accessing system resources and other
low-level entities
Math, a class that provides standard mathematical
methods
String, the class that is used to represent strings
Because the classes in the java.lang
package are so essential, the java.lang
package is implicitly imported by every Java source file. In other
words, you can refer to all of the classes and interfaces in
java.lang using their simple names.
Figure 10.1 shows the class hierarchy for
the java.lang package.

Synopsis
Class Name:
java.lang.Boolean
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
java.io.Serializable
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The Boolean class provides an object wrapper
for a boolean value. This is useful when you
need to treat a boolean value as an object. For
example, there are a number of utility methods that take a reference
to an Object as one of their arguments. You cannot
specify a boolean value for one of these arguments,
but you can provide a reference to a Boolean object
that encapsulates the boolean value. Furthermore,
as of JDK 1.1, the Boolean class is necessary to 
support the Reflection API and class literals.
Class Summary
public final class java.lang.Boolean {
    // Constants
    public final static Boolean FALSE;
    public final static Boolean TRUE;
    public final static Class TYPE;                    // New in 1.1
    // Constructors
    public Boolean(boolean value);
    public Boolean(String s);
    // Class Methods
    public static boolean getBoolean(String name);
    public static Boolean valueOf(String s);
    // Instance Methods
    public boolean booleanValue();
    public boolean equals(Object obj);
    public int hashCode();
    public String toString();
}
Constants
TRUE
public static final Boolean TRUE
Description
A constant Boolean object that has the
value true.
FALSE
public static final Boolean FALSE
Description
A constant Boolean object that has the
value false.
TYPE
public static final Class TYPE 
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The Class object that represents the type
boolean.
It is always true that Boolean.TYPE 
== boolean.class.
Constructors
Boolean
public Boolean(boolean value)
Parameters
value
The boolean value to be made into
a Boolean object.
Description
Constructs a Boolean object with the given
value.
public Boolean(String s)
Parameters
s
The string to be made into a Boolean
object.
Description
Constructs a Boolean object with the value
specified by the given string. If the string equals 'true' (ignoring
case), the value of the object is true; otherwise
it is false.
Class Methods
getBoolean
public static boolean getBoolean(String name)
Parameters
name
The name of a system property.
Returns
The boolean value of the system property.
Description
This methods retrieves the boolean value of a named system
property. 
valueOf
public static Boolean valueOf(String s)
Parameters
s
The string to be made into a Boolean
object.
Returns
A Boolean object with the value specified
by the given string.
Description
This method returns a Boolean object with
the value true if the string equals 
"true" (ignoring
case); otherwise the value of the object is false.
Instance Methods
booleanValue
public boolean booleanValue()
Returns
The boolean value contained by the object.
equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Parameters
obj
The object to be compared with this object.
Returns
true if the objects are equal; false
if they are not.
Overrides
Object.equals()
Description
This method returns true if obj
is an instance of Boolean, and it contains the
same value as the object this method is associated with.
hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns
A hashcode based on the boolean value
of the object.
Overrides
Object.hashCode()
toString
public String toString()
Returns
"true" 
if the value of the object is true;
"false" otherwise.
Overrides
Object.toString()
Description
This method returns a string representation of the Boolean
object.
