Synopsis
Class Name:
java.lang.System
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The System
class provides access to various information about the operating
system environment in which a program is running. For example, the
System class defines variables that allow access
to the standard I/O streams and methods that allow a program to
run the garbage collector and stop the Java virtual machine.
All of the variables and methods in the System
class are static. In other words, it is not necessary
to create an instance of the System class in
order to use its variables and methods. In fact, the System
class does not define any public constructors,
so it cannot be instantiated.
The System
class supports the concept of system properties
that can be queried and set. The following properties are guaranteed
always to be defined:
Property Name
Description
file.encoding
The character encoding for the default locale (Java 1.1 only)
file.encoding.pkg
The package that contains converters between local encodings and Unicode (Java 1.1 only)
file.separator
File separator ('/' on UNIX, ' \' on Windows)
java.class.path
The class path
java.class.version
Java class version number
java.compiler
The just-in-time compiler to use, if any (Java 1.1 only)
java.home
Java installation directory
java.vendor
Java vendor-specific string
java.vendor.url
Java vendor URL
java.version
Java version number
line.separator
Line separator(' \n' on UNIX, ' \r\n' on Windows)
os.arch
Operating system architecture
os.name
Operating system name
os.version
Operating system version
path.separator
Path separator (':' on UNIX, ',' on Windows)
user.dir
User's current working directory when the properties were initialized
user.home
User's home directory
user.language
The two-letter language code of the default locale (Java 1.1 only)
user.name
User's account name
user.region
The two-letter country code of the default locale (Java 1.1 only)
user.timezone
The default time zone (Java 1.1 only)
Additional properties may be defined by the run-time environment.
The -D command-line option can be used to define
system properties when a program is run.
The Runtime class is related to the System
class; it provides access to information about the environment in
which a program is running.

Variables
err
public static final PrintStream err
Description
  
  
The standard error stream. In an application environment,
this variable refers to a java.io.PrintStream
object that is associated with the standard error output for the
process running the Java virtual machine. In an applet environment,
the PrintStream is likely to be associated with
a separate window, although this is not guaranteed.
The value of err can be set using the 
setErr() method.  The value of err
can only be set if the currenly installed SecurityManager
does not throw a SecurityException when the
request is made.
Prior to to Java 1.1, err was not 
final. It has been made final
as of Java 1.1 because the unchecked ability to set err 
is a security hole.
in
public static final InputStream in 
Description
  
  
The standard input stream. In an application environment,
this variable refers to a java.io.InputStream
object that is associated with the standard input for the process
running the Java virtual machine.
The value of in can be set using the 
setIn() method.  The value of in
can only be set if the currenly installed SecurityManager
does not throw a SecurityException when the
request is made.
Prior to to Java 1.1, in was not 
final. It has been made final
as of Java 1.1 because the unchecked ability to set in 
is a security hole.
out
public static final PrintStream out 
Description
  
  
The standard output stream. In an application environment,
this variable refers to a java.io.PrintStream
object that is associated with the standard output for the process
running the Java virtual machine. In an applet environment, the
PrintStream is likely to be associated with a
separate window, although this is not guaranteed.
out
is the most commonly used of the three I/O streams provided
by the System class. Even in GUI-based applications,
sending output to this stream can be useful for debugging. The usual
idiom for sending output to this stream is:
System.out.println("Some text");
The value of out can be set using the 
setOut() method.  The value of out
can only be set if the currenly installed SecurityManager
does not throw a SecurityException when the
request is made.
Prior to to Java 1.1, out was not 
final. It has been made final
as of Java 1.1 because the unchecked ability to set out 
is a security hole.
Class Methods
arraycopy
   public static void arraycopy(Object src, int src_position, Object dst, int dst_position, int length)  
Parameters
src
The source array.
src_position
An index into the source array.
dst
The destination array.
dst_position
An index into the destination array.
length
The number of elements to be copied.
Throws
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
If the values of the src_position,
dst_position, and length arguments
imply accessing either array with an index that is less than zero
or an index greater than or equal to the number of elements in the
array.
ArrayStoreException
If the type of value stored in the src
array cannot be stored in the dst array.
NullPointerException
If src or dst
is null.
Description
This method copies a range of array elements from the src
array to the dst array. The number of elements
that are copied is specified by length. The elements
at positions src_position through src_position+length-1
in src are copied to the positions dst_position
through dst_position+length-1 in dst,
respectively.
If src and dst refer
to the same array, the copying is done as if the array elements
were first copied to a temporary array and then copied to the destination
array.
Before this method does any copying, it performs a number
of checks. If either src or dst
are null, the method throws a NullPointerException
and dst is not modified.
If any of the following conditions are true, the method throws
an ArrayStoreException, and dst
is not modified:
Either src or dst
refers to an object that is not an array.
src and dst refer
to arrays whose element types are different primitive types.
src refers to an array that has
elements that contain a primitive type, while dst
refers to an array that has elements that contain a reference type,
or vice versa.
If any of the following conditions are true, the method throws
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and dst
is not modified:
srcOffset, dstOffset,
or length is negative.
srcOffset+length is greater than
src.length().
dstOffset+length is greater than
dst.length().
Otherwise, if an element in the source array being
copied cannot be converted to the type of the destination array
using the rules of the assignment operator, the method throws an
ArrayStoreException when the problem occurs.
Since the problem is discovered during the copy operation, the state
of the dst array reflects the incomplete copy
operation.
currentTimeMillis
public static native long currentTimeMillis()
Returns
The current time as the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00
UTC, January 1, 1970.
Description
This method returns the current time as the number of milliseconds
since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. It will not overflow until
the year 292280995.
The java.util.Date class provides more
extensive facilities for dealing with times and dates.
exit
public static void exit(int status)
Parameters
status
The exit status code to use.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkExit() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method causes the Java virtual machine
 to exit with the given status code. This method
works by calling the exit() method of the current
Runtime object. By convention, a nonzero status
code indicates abnormal termination. This method never returns.
gc
public static void gc()
Description
This method causes the Java virtual machine to run the garbage
collector in the current thread. This method works by calling the
gc() method of the current Runtime object.
The garbage collector finds objects that will never be used
again because there are no live references to them. After it finds
these objects, the garbage collector frees the storage occupied
by these objects.
The garbage collector is normally run continuously in a thread
with the lowest possible priority, so that it works intermittently
to reclaim storage. The gc() method allows a
program to invoke the garbage collector explicitly when necessary.
getProperties
public static Properties getProperties()
Returns
A Properties object that contains the values
of all the system properies.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkPropertiesAccess()
method of the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method returns all of the defined system properties encapsulated
in a java.util.Properties
object. If there are no system properties currently defined, a set
of default system properties is created and initialized. As discussed
in the description of the System class, some
system properties are guaranteed always to be defined.
getProperty
public static String getProperty(String key)
Parameters
key
The name of a system property.
Returns
The value of the named system property or null if
the named property is not defined.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkPropertyAccess()
method of the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method returns the value of the named system property. 
If there is no definition for the named property,
the method returns null. If there are no system
properties currently defined, a set of default system properties
is created and initialized. As discussed in the description of the
System class, some system properties are guaranteed
always to be defined.
public static String getProperty(String key, String def)
Parameters
key
The name of a system property.
def
A default value for the property.
Returns
The value of the named system property, or the default value
if the named property is not defined.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkPropertyAccess()
method of the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method returns the value of the named system property.
If there is no definition for the named property,
the method returns the default value as specified by the def
parameter. If there are no system properties currently defined,
a set of default system properties is created and initialized. As
discussed earlier in the description of the System class,
some system properties are guaranteed to always be defined.
getSecurityManager
public static SecurityManager getSecurityManager()
Returns
A reference to the installed SecurityManager
object or null if there is no SecurityManager
object installed.
Description
This method returns a reference to the installed SecurityManager
object. If there is no SecurityManager object
installed, the method returns null.
getenv
public static String getenv(String name)
Availability
Deprecated as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
The name of a system-dependent environment variable.
Returns
The value of the environment variable or null
if the variable is not defined.
Description
This method is obsolete; it always throws an error.  Use 
getProperties() and the -D
option instead.
identityHashCode
public static native int identityHashCode(Object x)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
x
An object.
Returns
The identity hashcode value for the specified object.
Description
This method returns the same hashcode value for the specified
object as would be returned by the default hashCode()
method of Object, regardless of whether or not
the object's class overrides hashCode().
load
public void load(String filename)
Parameters
filename
A string that specifies the complete path of the
file to be loaded.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkLink() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
UnsatisfiedLinkError
If the method is unsuccessful in loading the specified
dynamically linked library.
Description
This method loads the specified dynamically linked library.
This method works by calling the load() method
of the current Runtime object.
loadLibrary
public void loadLibrary(String libname)
Parameters
libname
A string that specifies the name of a dynamically linked
library.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkLink() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
UnsatisfiedLinkError
If the method is unsuccessful in loading the specified
dynamically linked library.
Description
This method loads the specified dynamically linked library.
It looks for the specified library in a platform-specific way. This
method works by calling the loadLibrary() method
of the current Runtime object.
runFinalization
public static void runFinalization()
Description
This method causes the Java virtual machine to run the finalize()
methods of any objects in the finalization queue in the current
thread. This method works by calling the runFinalization()
method of the current Runtime object.
When the garbage collector discovers that there are no references
to an object, it checks to see if the object has a finalize()
method that has never been called. If the object has such a finalize()
method, the object is placed in the finalization queue. While there
is a reference to the object in the finalization queue, the object
is no longer considered garbage collectable.
Normally, the objects in the finalization queue are handled
by a separate finalization thread that runs continuously at a very
low priority. The finalization thread removes an object from the
queue and calls its finalize() method. As long
as the finalize() method does not generate a
reference to the object, the object again becomes available for
garbage collection.
Because the finalization thread runs at a very low priority,
there may be a long delay from the time that an object is put on
the finalization queue until the time that its finalize()
method is called. The runFinalization() method
allows a program to run the finalize() methods
explicitly. This can be useful when there is a shortage of some
resource that is released by a finalize() method.
runFinalizersOnExit
public static void runFinalizersOnExit(boolean value)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
value
A boolean value that specifies whether or not
finalization occurs on exit.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkExit() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method specifies whether or not the finalize() 
methods of all objects that have finalize() methods
are run before the Java virtual machine exits.  By default, the
finalizers are not run on exit.  This method works by calling
the runFinalizersOnExit() method of the current
Runtime object.
setErr
public static void setErr(PrintStream err)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
err
A PrintStream object to use for the standard error
stream.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkExec() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method sets the standard error stream to be this 
PrintStream object.
setIn
public static void setIn(InputStream in)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
in
A InputStream object to use for the standard input
stream.
Throws
SecurityException

the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method sets the standard input stream to be this 
InputStream object.
setOut
public static void setOut(PrintStream out)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters

PrintStream object.
setProperties
public static void setProperties(Properties props)
Parameters
props
A reference to a Properties object.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkPropertiesAccess()
method of the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method replaces the current set of system property definitions
with a new set of system property definitions that are encapsulated
by the given Properties object. As discussed
in the description of the System class, some
system properties are guaranteed to always be defined.
setSecurityManager
public static void setSecurityManager(SecurityManager s)
Parameters
s
A reference to a SecurityManager
object.
Throws
SecurityException
If a SecurityManager object has
already been installed.
Description
This method installs the given SecurityManager
object. If s is null, then
no SecurityManager object is installed. Once
a SecurityManager object is installed, any subsequent
calls to this method throw a SecurityException.
