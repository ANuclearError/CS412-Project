This chapter discusses
the higher levels of program structure for Java programs. The two
levels of organization discussed in this chapter are compilation
units and packages. A compilation unit contains
the source code for one or more classes or interfaces. A
package is a collection of related compilation units.
This
chapter also discusses the two most common top-level Java program
architectures: applications and applets. An
application is a stand-alone Java program that
can be run directly
from the command line (or other operating system environment).
An applet is a Java program that must be run
from within another program, such as a Web browser. In the future,
applets will even be hosted by other environments,
such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants.
7.1 Compilation Units
A compilation unit
is the highest-level syntactic structure that Java recognizes:
Only one of the classes or interfaces declared in a compilation unit
can be declared public.
A compilation
unit usually corresponds to a single source code file. However,
the Java language specification allows compilation units to be stored
in a database. If compilation units are stored in a database, the
limit of one public class or interface per compilation
unit does not apply, as long as there is a way to extract the compilation
units from the database and place them in individual files that
contain no more than one public class or interface
per file. This exception to the one public class
or interface per compilation unit rule is useful if you are implementing
a Java development environment.
Every compilation unit
is part of exactly one package. That package is specified by the
package directive that appears at the beginning
of the compilation unit. If there is no package directive,
the compilation unit is part of the default package.
