5.5 Interface Declarations
An interface declaration creates a reference type in Java. An
interface declaration is similar to a class declaration, with the
following two very important differences.
All of the methods in an interface are implicitly abstract.
Every method declaration in an interface specifies the formal parameters
and return type of the method, but it does not include an implementation
of the method.
All of the variables in an interface
are implicitly static and final.
Interfaces are most useful for declaring that an otherwise unrelated
set of classes have a common set of methods. For example, if you want
to store a variety of objects in a database, you might want all of
those objects to have fetch and store methods. The fetch and store
methods of each object require different implementations, so it makes
sense to declare the fetch and store methods in an interface
declaration. Then any class that needs fetch and store methods can
implement the interface.
The formal definition for an interface declaration is:
While the above diagram may seem complicated, an interface declaration
is really made up of five distinct things:
Optional modifiers that specify attributes of the class
 
The keyword interface
 
An identifier that names the interface
An optional extends
clause that specifies the super interfaces of the declared interface
Any number of interface member declarations, which can
include variables and methods
Here are some sample interface declarations:
interface Dyn {
    double squeeze();
}
interface Press extends Dyn {
    double squeeze(double theta);
}
Here is an example of a class
that implements Press:
class Clamp implements Press {
      ...
    double squeeze() {
        return squeeze(0);
    }
    double squeeze(double theta) {
        return force*Math.cos(theta);
    }
      ...
}
Since the Press interface extends the
Dyn interface, the Clamp class
must implement the methods declared in both Dyn and
Press.

Interface Modifiers
The keywords public and
abstract can appear
as modifiers at the beginning of an interface declaration.  In this
situation, these modifiers have the following meanings:
public
If an interface is declared public, it can be
referenced by any class or interface. If the public
modifier is not used, however, the interface can only be referenced by
classes and interfaces in the same package. A single source file, or
compilation unit, can only declare one public class
or interface (see Compilation Units for an
exception to this rule).
abstract
An interface is implicitly abstract; so
all of the methods in an interface are implicitly
abstract. Including the abstract
modifier in an interface declaration is permitted, but it does not
change the meaning of the interface declaration.

Interface Name
The identifier that follows the keyword interface
is the name of the interface.  This identifier can be used as a
reference type wherever the interface is accessible.

Interface Types
Interface Inheritance
The extends clause specifies any super-interfaces
of the interface being declared; the extends
keyword can be followed by the names of one or more interfaces. If an
interface has an extends clause, the clause can
only name other interfaces.
Including an interface in the extends clause of
another interface means that the declared interface inherits the
variables and methods declared in the super-interface. A class that
implements the declared interface must implement all of the methods in
the declared interface, as well as all of the methods inherited from
the super-interface.
If an interface declaration does not include an
extends clause, the interface does not extend any
other interfaces.
Interface Members
The members of an interface can be variables or methods; an interface
cannot have constructors, static initializers, instance initializers,
nested top-level classes or interfaces, or member classes:

Interface Variables
Interface Variables
Any field variables declared in an interface are implicitly
static and final. In other
words, field variables in an interface are named constants. Every
field variable declaration in an interface must contain an initializer
that sets the value of the named constant:
A variable declaration in an interface is made up of three distinct
things:
Optional modifiers that specify attributes of the variable.
A type, which can be either a primitive type or a reference type.
Any number of identifiers that name variables. Each name must be
followed by an initializer that sets the value of the constant.

Interface variable modifiers
Variables in an interface are implicitly static and
final.  Including these modifiers in a variable
declaration is permitted, but it is not necessary and it does not
change the meaning of the variable declaration. Thus, by definition,
all variables in an interface are named constants.
If an interface is declared public, a field
variable declared in the interface is public, even
if it is declared with the private or
protected modifier. If an interface is not declared
public, however, any field variables in the
interface have the default accessibility, which means that they are
only accessible in classes and interfaces in the same package.
It is an error to declare a field variable in an interface with the
transient or volatile modifier.

Interface Modifiers;
Variable modifiers
Interface variable type
If the interface variable declaration uses a primitive type, the
variable contains a constant value of the specified primitive type. If
the declaration uses a reference type, the variable contains a
constant reference to the specified type of object. The presence of
square brackets in a variable declaration, after either the type or
variable name, indicates that the variable contains a reference to an
array.
References

Primitive Types;
Reference Types
Interface variable name
The identifier that follows the variable type is the name of the
variable. This identifier can be used anywhere that the variable is
accessible.
It is an error to declare two field variables with the same name in
the same interface. It is also an error to declare a field variable
with the same name as a method declared in the same interface or any
of its super-interfaces.
An interface that extends another interface inherits all of the
variables in its super-interface.  Any class that implements an
interface has access to all of the variables defined in that
interface, as well as the variables inherited from super-interfaces.
If a field variable is declared with the same name as a variable
declared in a super-interface, the variable in the super-interface is
considered to be shadowed. If a variable is shadowed in an interface,
it cannot be accessed as a field of that interface. However, a
shadowed variable can be accessed by casting a reference to an object
that implements the interface to a reference to the appropriate
super-interface in which the variable is not shadowed. For example:
interface A {
    int x = 4;
}
interface B extends A {
    int x = 7;
}
class Z implements B {
    Z() {
        int i = x;              // i gets the value of B's x
        int h = ((A)this).x;    // h gets the value of A's x
    }
}
The variable x in interface A is
shadowed by the variable x in interface
B. Class Z implements interface
B, so a reference to x produces
the value 7, as defined in interface B. However, it
is possible to access the shadowed variable by casting
this to a reference to interface
A.
In some situations, an interface may inherit multiple field variables
with the same name. This leads to a single, ambiguous variable
name. For example:
interface A {
    int x = 4;
}
interface B {
    int x = 43;
}
interface C extends A, B {
    int y = 22;
}
class Z implements C {
    public static void main (String[] argv) {
        System.out.println(x);        // Ambiguous
    }
}
In this example, the interface C inherits two
variables named x.  This is fine, as long as
C does not refer to the variable
x by its simple name in any of its declarations. If
C needs to use x, it must
qualify the name with the appropriate interface name (e.g.,
A.x). Class Z implements
interface C, so it also has access to two variables
named x. As a result, the use of
x in main() is ambiguous. This
problem can be resolved by qualifying the variable name with the
appropriate interface name (e.g., B.x).
A class that implements multiple interfaces can also inherit multiple
field variables with the same name. Again, this leads to a single,
ambiguous variable name:
interface A {
    int x = 4;
}
interface B {
    int x = 43;
}
class Z implements A, B {
    public static void main (String[] argv) {
        System.out.println(x);        // Ambiguous
    }
}
The class Z implements both interface
A and interface B, so it
inherits two variables named x. As a result, the
use of x in main() is
ambiguous. This problem can again be resolved by qualifying the
variable name with the appropriate interface name (e.g.,
B.x).

Interface variable initializers
Every variable declaration in an interface must include an
initializer that sets the value of the constant. The initializer does
not, however, have to be a constant expression. If the variable is of
a non-array type, the expression in the initializer is evaluated and
the variable is set to the result of the expression, as long as the
result is assignment-compatible with the variable. If the variable is
of an array type, the initializer must be an array initializer.
The initializer for a variable in an interface cannot refer to any
variables that are declared after its own declaration.

Interface Methods
Any methods declared in an interface are implicitly
abstract. In other words, methods in an interface
do not have a specified implementation:
A method declaration in an interface is made up of six distinct things:
Optional modifiers that specify attributes of the method
A type that specifies the type of value returned by
the method
An identifier that names the method
A list of formal parameters that specifies the values that are passed
to the method
An optional throws clause that specifies any exceptions that can be
thrown by the method
A semicolon, since the method declaration does not include an
implementation

Interface method modifiers
Methods in an interface are implicitly
abstract. Including this modifier in a method
declaration is permitted, but it is not necessary and it does not
change the meaning of the method declaration.  Thus, by definition,
none of the methods in an interface has a specified implementation.
If an interface is declared public, a method
declared in the interface is public, even if it is
declared with the private or
protected modifier. If the interface is not
declared public, however, any methods in the
interface have the default accessibility, which means that they are
only accessible in classes and interfaces in the same package.
It is an error to declare a method in an interface with the
static, final,
native, or synchronized
modifier.  These modifiers are not allowed because defining a method
in an interface is not meant to imply anything about the nature of the
implementation, other than the return type of the method and the types
of the formal parameters. A class that implements the interface has
control over the implementation of the methods and can use any of
these modifiers when they are appropriate for the implementation.

Interface method return type
A method declaration in an interface must specify the type of value
returned by the method. The return value can be of a primitive type or
of a reference type. The presence of square brackets in a method
declaration, after either the return type or the formal parameters,
indicates that the method returns a reference to the specified type of
array.  If the method does not return a value, the declaration uses
void to indicate that. The return type comes before
the name of the method in the method declaration.
References
Array Types;
Method return type;
Primitive Types;
Reference Types
Interface method name
The identifier that follows the return type is the name of the
method. This identifier can be used anywhere that the method is
accessible.
It is an error to declare two methods that have the same name, the
same number of parameters, and the same type for each corresponding
parameter in the same interface. It is also an error to declare a
method with the same name as a variable declared in the same interface
or any of its super-interfaces.
An interface that extends another interface inherits all of the
methods in its super-interface.  Any class that implements an
interface must provide an implementation for each of the methods
defined in that interface, as well as each of the methods inherited
from super-interfaces.
If an interface inherits methods from multiple super-interfaces that
have the same name, formal parameters, and return type, there is no
problem. The various super-interfaces are in agreement about the
method. The interface can also override the inherited methods by
declaring a method with the same name, formal parameters, and return
type. In any case, a class that implements the interface has to
provide a single implementation for the method.
However, if an interface inherits methods from multiple
super-interfaces that have the same name and same formal parameters,
but different return types, a compile-time error results. By the same
token, if the interface attempts to override an inherited method with
a method that has the same name and same formal parameters, but a
different return type, a compile-time error results.
If an interface inherits methods from multiple super-interfaces that
have the same name but different formal parameters, there is no
problem. The methods are simply considered overloaded in the
interface. The interface can even declare additional methods that have
the same name but different formal parameters. A class that implements
the interface simply has to provide an implementation for each of the
overloaded methods.

Method Call Expression
Interface method formal parameters
The formal parameters in a method declaration specify a list of
variables to which values are assigned when the method is called. If a
method has no formal parameters, the parentheses must still appear in
the method declaration. The presence of square brackets in a formal
parameter declaration, either as part of a reference type or after the
name of a formal parameter, indicates that the formal parameter is an
array type.

Interface method throws clause
If a method is expected to throw any exceptions, the method
declaration must declare that fact in a throws
clause. If the declaration of a method in an interface contains a
throws clause, any method in a sub-interface that
overrides that method cannot include any classes in its
throws clause that are not declared in the
overridden method.

Method throws clause
Nested Top-Level Interfaces
Nested top-level interfaces are interfaces that
are declared inside of another class. Just as with a top-level
interface declaration, the declaration of a nested top-level interface
creates a reference type in Java. Here's the formal definition of
a nested top-level interface:
A nested top-level interface 
can be accessed outside of its enclosing class by
qualifying its name with the name of its enclosing class, as follows:
EnclosingClass.InnerInterface
The syntax for declaring nested top-level interfaces 
is not supported prior to Java 1.1.
References
Nested top-level classes and interfaces;
SimpleInterfaceDeclaration 5.5
Inner interface modifiers
The keywords public, abstract, 
and static can be used in the declaration of a
nested top-level interface. In this situation, these 
modifiers have the following meanings:
public
If a nested top-level interface is declared
public, it is accessible from any class or
interface that can access the enclosing class. If the
public modifier is not used, however, the nested
top-level interface can only be referenced by classes and interfaces
in the same package as the enclosing class.
abstract
A nested top-level interface is implicitly abstract; thus,
all of the methods in the interface are implicitly
abstract. Including the abstract
modifier in a nested top-level interface declaration is permitted, 
but it does not change the meaning of the interface declaration.
static
A nested top-level interface is implicitly static. 
Including the static
modifier in a nested top-level interface declaration is permitted, 
but it does not change the meaning of the interface declaration.

Inner interface members
The remainder of a nested top-level interface 
declaration is the same as that for a top-level 
interface declaration, which is described 
in Interface Declarations.
