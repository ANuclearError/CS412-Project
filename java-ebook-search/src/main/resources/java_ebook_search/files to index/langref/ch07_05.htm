7.5 Applications
For a Java program to run
as an application, it must have at least one public
class that contains a public static
method called main() that takes exactly one parameter,
an array of String objects.
Here is a very simple
sample application that outputs "Hello World!" and then exits:
class DoIt {
    public static void main  (String argv[]){
         System.out.println ("Hello World!");
    }
}
The main() method must be public
so that the Java virtual machine can find it. If the method
is not public, its name is not included in the
compiler's output. The system does not create any objects prior
to the start of the application's main() method,
so the main() method must be static
because it cannot be associated with an object.
If an application has a graphical user interface, then it typically creates
a java.awt.Frame object in main().
The Frame object acts as the top-level window
for the application.
In Sun's implementation of Java,
you run a Java application by running the Java interpreter with
a command-line argument that specifies the name of the class that
contains the main(). The name of the Java interpreter
is java. Here's the command-line for our sample
application:
C:\&gt; java DoIt
The capitalization
of the class name on the command line must match the capitalization
of the class name within the program. If the class is part of a
named package, the name of the class must be qualified with the
package name. For example, if you have a package
called COM.geomaker
and it contains the class called DoIt, you would
use the following command to run the application:
C:\&gt; java COM.geomaker.DoIt
Any additional information that you provide on the command line is passed
to the application as command line arguments. These arguments are
passed to the application using the String array
passed to main(). The number of elements in the
array is equal to the number of arguments passed to the application.
If there are no arguments to the application, the length of the
array passed to main() is zero.
