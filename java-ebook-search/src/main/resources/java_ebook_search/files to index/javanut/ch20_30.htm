20.30 java.awt.event.WindowListener (JDK 1.1)
This interface defines the methods that an object must
implement to "listen" for window events on AWT components.
When a WindowEvent occurs, an AWT component
notifies its registered WindowListener objects by
invoking one of their methods.
An easy way to implement this interface is by subclassing
the WindowAdapter class.
public abstract interface WindowListener extends EventListener {
    // Public Instance Methods
            public abstract void windowActivated(WindowEvent e);
            public abstract void windowClosed(WindowEvent e);
            public abstract void windowClosing(WindowEvent e);
            public abstract void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent e);
            public abstract void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent e);
            public abstract void windowIconified(WindowEvent e);
            public abstract void windowOpened(WindowEvent e);
}
