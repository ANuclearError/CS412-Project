24.2 java.io.BufferedOutputStream (JDK 1.0)
This class is a FilterOutputStream that provides
output data buffering--output efficiency is increased by storing values
to be written in a buffer and actually writing them out only
when the buffer fills up or when the flush() method
is called. Create a BufferedOutputStream by
specifying the OutputStream that is to have
buffering applied in the call to the constructor.
See also BufferedWriter.
public class BufferedOutputStream extends FilterOutputStream {
    // Public Constructors
            public BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out);
            public BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out, int size);
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected byte[] buf;
            protected int count;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public synchronized void flush() throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
            public synchronized void write(int b) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
            public synchronized void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
