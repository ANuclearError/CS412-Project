PipedReader is a character input stream that reads
characters from a PipedWriter character output
stream to which it is connected.  PipedReader
implements one-half of a pipe, and is useful for
communication between two threads of an application.
A PipedReader cannot be used until it is connected
to a PipedWriter object, which may be passed to the
PipedReader() constructor or to the
connect() method.
PipedReader inherits most of the methods of its
superclass.  See Reader for more information.
PipedReader is the character stream analog of
PipedInputStream. 
public class PipedReader extends Reader {
    // Public Constructors
            public PipedReader();
            public PipedReader(PipedWriter src) throws IOException;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Defines Reader
            public void connect(PipedWriter src) throws IOException;
            public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Defines Reader
}
