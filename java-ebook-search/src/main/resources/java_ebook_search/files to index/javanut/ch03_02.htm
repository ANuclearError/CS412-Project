3.2 Object Creation
Take another look at how we've been creating our circle
object:
Circle c = new Circle();
What are those parentheses doing there?  They make it look
like we're calling a function!  In fact, that is exactly
what we're doing.  Every class in Java has at least one
constructor method, which has the same name as the
class.  The purpose of a constructor is
to perform any necessary initialization for the new object.
Since we didn't define one for our Circle class,
Java gave us a default constructor that takes no arguments
and performs no special initialization.
The way it works is this: The new keyword creates a
new dynamic instance of the class--i.e., it allocates the new
object.  The constructor method is then called, passing the
new object implicitly (a this reference, as we saw
above), and passing the arguments specified between
parentheses explicitly.  
Defining a Constructor
There is some obvious initialization we could do for our
circle objects, so let's define a constructor.
Example 3.2
shows a constructor that lets us specify the initial values
for the center and radius of our new Circle object.
The example also shows a use of the this keyword, as
described in the previous section.
Example 3.2: A Constructor for the Circle Class
public class Circle {
    public double x, y, r;  // The center and the radius of the circle
    // The constructor method.
    public Circle(double x, double y, double r)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.r = r;
    }   
    public double circumference() { return 2 * 3.14159 * r; }
    public double area() { return 3.14159 * r*r; }
}
With the old, default constructor, we had to write code like
this:
Circle c = new Circle();
c.x = 1.414;  
c.y = -1.0;  
c.r = .25;
With this new constructor the initialization becomes part of
the object creation step:
Circle c = new Circle(1.414, -1.0, .25);
There are two important notes about naming and declaring
constructors: 
The constructor name is always the same as the class name.
The return type is implicitly an instance of the class.  No
return type is specified in constructor declarations, nor is
the void keyword used.  The this object is
implicitly returned; a constructor should not use a
return statement to return a value.
Multiple Constructors
Sometimes you'll want to be able to initialize an object in a
number of different ways, depending on what is most
convenient in a particular circumstance.  For example, we
might want to be able to initialize the radius of a circle
without initializing the center, or we might want to
initialize a circle to have the same center and radius as
another circle, or we might want to initialize all the
fields to default values.  Doing this is no problem: A class
can have any number of constructor methods.
Example 3.3
shows how.
Example 3.3: Multiple Circle Constructors
public class Circle {
    public double x, y, r;
    public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {
        this.x = x; this.y = y; this.r = r;
    }
    public Circle(double r) { x = 0.0; y = 0.0; this.r = r; }
    public Circle(Circle c) { x = c.x; y = c.y; r = c.r; }
    public Circle() { x = 0.0; y = 0.0; r = 1.0; }
    public double circumference() { return 2 * 3.14159 * r; }
    public double area() { return 3.14159 * r*r; }
}
Method Overloading
The surprising thing in this example (not so surprising if
you're a C++ programmer) is that all the constructor
methods have the same name!  So how can the compiler tell
them apart?  The way that you and I tell them apart is that the
four methods take different arguments and are useful in
different circumstances.  The compiler tells them apart in
the same way.  In Java, a method is distinguished by its
name, and by the number, type, and position of its
arguments.  This is not limited to constructor methods--any
two methods are not the same unless they have the same name,
and the same number of arguments of
the same type passed at the same position in the
argument list. When you call a method and there is more
than one method with the same name, the compiler
automatically picks the
one that matches the data types of the arguments you are
passing.
Defining methods with the same name and different argument
types is called method overloading.  It can
be a convenient technique, as long as you only give
methods the same name when they perform similar functions on
slightly different forms of input data. Overloaded methods
may have different return types, but only if they have
different arguments. Don't confuse
method overloading with method overriding, which we'll
discuss later.
this Again
There is a specialized use of the this keyword that
arises when a class has multiple constructors--it can be
used from a constructor to invoke one of the other
constructors of the same class.  So we could rewrite the
additional constructors from
Example 3.3
in terms of the first one like this:
public Circle(double x, double y, double r) { 
    this.x = x; this.y = y; this.r = r; 
}
public Circle(double r) { this(0.0, 0.0, r); }
public Circle(Circle c) { this(c.x, c.y, c.r); }
public Circle() { this(0.0, 0.0, 1.0); }
Here, the this() call refers to whatever constructor
of the class takes the specified type of arguments.  This
would be a more impressive example, of course, if the first
constructor that we were invoking did a more significant
amount of initialization, as it might, for example, if we were
writing a more complicated class.
There is a very important restriction on this this
syntax: it may only appear as the first statement in a
constructor.  It may, of course, be followed by any
additional initialization that a particular version of the
constructor needs to do.  The reason for this restriction
involves the automatic invocation of superclass constructor
methods, which we'll explore later in this chapter.
