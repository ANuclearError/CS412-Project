The java.awt package is the Abstract Windowing
Toolkit.  The classes of this package may be roughly divided
into three categories (see
Figure 18.1
and
Figure 18.2).
Graphics: These classes define colors, fonts, images,
polygons, and so forth.
Components: These classes are GUI (graphical user
interface) components such as buttons, menus, lists, and
dialog boxes.
Layout Managers: These classes control the layout of
components within their container objects.
Note that separate packages, java.awt.datatransfer,
java.awt.event, and java.awt.image, contain
classes for cut-and-paste, event handling, and image
manipulation.
Figure 18.1: Graphics, event, and exception classes of the java.awt package
In the first category of classes, Graphics is
probably the most important.  This class defines methods for
doing line and text drawing and image painting.  It relies
on other classes such as Color, Font,
Image, and Polygon.  Image is itself
an important class, used in many places in java.awt
and throughout the related package java.awt.image.
Event is another important class that describes a
user or window system event that has occurred.  In Java 1.1,
Event is superseded by the AWTEvent class.
Component and MenuComponent are root classes
in the second category of java.awt classes.  Their
subclasses are GUI components that can appear in interfaces
and menus.  The Container class is one that contains
components and arranges them visually.  You add components
to a container with the add() method and specify a
layout manager for the container with the
setLayout() method.
There are three commonly used Container subclasses.
Frame is a toplevel window that can contain a
menu bar and have a custom cursor and an icon.
Dialog is a dialog window.  Panel is a
container that does not have its own window--it is contained
within some other container.
The third category of java.awt classes is the layout
managers.  The subclasses of LayoutManager are
responsible for arranging the Component objects
contained within a specified Container.
GridBagLayout, BorderLayout, and
GridLayout are probably the most useful of these
layout managers.
See Chapter 8, New AWT Features, for
examples of using some of the new Java 1.1 features of this package.

18.1 java.awt.AWTError (JDK 1.0)
Signals that an error has occurred in the
java.awt package.
public class AWTError extends Error {
    // Public Constructor
            public AWTError(String msg);
