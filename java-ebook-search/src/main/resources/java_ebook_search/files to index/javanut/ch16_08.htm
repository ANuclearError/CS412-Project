javap
Name
javap---The Java Class Disassembler
Availability
JDK 1.0 and later.
Synopsis
javap [ options ] classnames
Description
javap disassembles the class files specified by the
class names on the command line and prints a human-readable
version of those classes.
By default, javap prints declarations of the
non-private members of each of the classes specified
on the command line.  The -l, -p, and
-c options specify additional information to be
printed, including a complete disassembly of the byte-codes
in each of the specified classes.  javap can also be
used to run the class verifier on Java classes.
Options
-c
Print the Java Virtual Machine instructions for each of the
methods in each of the specified classes.  This option
disassembles all methods, including private methods.
-classpath path
The path that javap uses to look up the classes named
on the command line.  This option overrides the default
path and any path specified by the CLASSPATH
environment variable.  The path specified is an
ordered list of directories and ZIP files, separated by
colons on UNIX systems or semicolons on Windows systems.
To specify additional directories or ZIP files for
javap to search without overriding the default system
class path, use the CLASSPATH environment variable.
See the java reference page for more information on
specifying paths.
-h
Outputs the class in a form suitable for inclusion in a C
header file.
-l
Prints line numbers and local variable tables in addition to
the public fields of the class.  Note that line numbers and local
variable information is included for use with
debuggers. Local variable information is available only if a
class was compiled with the -g option to
javac; line number information is available only
if a class was compiled without the -O option.
-p
Prints private methods and
variables of the specified class in addition to the public
ones. Note that some compilers (though not javac) may
allow this private field information to be "obfuscated"
in such a way that private fields and method arguments
no longer have meaningful names.  This makes Java classes harder
to disassemble or reverse engineer.
-s
Outputs the class member declarations using the internal
Virtual Machine format.
-v
Verbose.  Outputs additional information (in the form of
Java comments) about each member of each specified class.
-verify
Causes javap to run the class verifier on the
specified classes and display the results of verification.
-version
Causes javap to display its version number.
Environment
CLASSPATH
Specifies an ordered list (colon-separated on UNIX,
semicolon-separated on Windows systems) of directories and
ZIP files in which javap should look for class 
definitions.  When a path is specified with this environment
variable, javap always implicitly appends the location
of the system classes to the end of the path.  If this
environment variable is not specified, the default path
is the current directory and the system classes.  This
variable is overridden by the -classpath option.
