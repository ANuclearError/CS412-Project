10.3 A More Complex Bean
Example 10.2
shows another bean, YesNoDialog.  This bean creates
a dialog box that displays a simple message to the user and
asks the user to respond by clicking the Yes,
No, or Cancel button.
Figure 10.1
shows the bean being manipulated in Sun's beanbox tool
and also shows a dialog displayed by the bean.
Figure 10.1: The YesNoDialog bean in the beanbox
The YesNoDialog bean uses a custom
AnswerEvent type to notify AnswerListener
objects when the user has dismissed the dialog by clicking
on one of its three buttons.  This new event class and
listener interface are defined in the next section.
Note that YesNoDialog is a subclass of
Object, not Dialog.  This is a result of the
requirement for a bean to have a no-argument constructor.
Because all dialog boxes must be associated with a
Frame, Dialog does not have a no-argument
constructor, and this means that subclasses of
Dialog cannot have meaningful no-argument
constructors, either.  As a result, YesNoDialog
defers creation of its window and associated GUI
components until it is actually popped up with the
display() method.  Another beanbox
shortcoming is that it only recognizes methods with no arguments.
[1]
For this reason, the display() method has no
arguments, and so no Frame can be specified through
that method either.  Since a parent Frame cannot be
specified, YesNoDialog cannot create a
Dialog object, and instead simulates a dialog box
with a Frame window.  An alternative would have been
to define a bean property through which the required
Frame could be specified.
[1] 
The beanbox tool shipped with the February 1997
version of the BDK has a number of shortcomings.  In part, this is
due to the fact that the BDK is a new technology and not as
stable or robust as the JDK.  It is also because
beanbox is intended as a test environment, not an
actual programmer's tool.
Since YesNoDialog is not a subclass of
Component, it has to define its own properties and
accessor methods for fonts and colors; normally these would
simply be inherited from Component.  Since this bean
is not a Component subclass, it is an "invisible"
bean that does not have a graphical representation of its
own.  (It pops up a window when the display() method
is called, but that is not the same as having a graphical
representation that appears within another window.)
Different tools treat invisible beans differently.
beanbox simply displays the classname of invisible
beans.
Notice that YesNoDialog does not use any classes
from the java.beans package.  One of the surprising
things about beans is that they typically do not have to use
any classes from this package.  As we'll see in later
sections, it is the auxiliary classes that are shipped with
a bean that make heavy use of that package.
