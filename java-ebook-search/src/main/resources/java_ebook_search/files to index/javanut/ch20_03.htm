20.3 java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type indicates that an adjustment has been
made to an Adjustable object--usually, this means
that the user has interacted with a Scrollbar
component.  
The getValue() method returns the new value
of the Adjustable object.  This is usually the most
important piece of information stored in the event.
getAdjustable() returns the Adjustable
object that was the source of the event.  It is a convenient
alternative to the inherited getSource() method.
The getID() method returns the type of an
AdjustmentEvent.  The standard AWT components only
generate adjustment events of type
AdjustmentEvent.ADJUSTMENT_VALUE_CHANGED.  
There are
several types of adjustments that can be made to an
Adjustable object, however, and the
getAdjustmentType() method returns one of five
constants to indicate which type has occurred.
UNIT_INCREMENT indicates that the Adjustable
value has been incremented by one unit, as in a
scroll-line-down operation.  UNIT_DECREMENT
indicates the opposite: scroll-line-up.
BLOCK_INCREMENT and BLOCK_DECREMENT indicate
that the Adjustable object has been incremented or
decremented by multiple units, as in a scroll-page-down or
scroll-page-up operation.  Finally, the TRACK
constant indicates that the Adjustable value has
been set to an absolute value unrelated to its previous
value, as when the user drags a scrollbar to a new
position.
