11.3 Character Encodings
Text representation has traditionally been one of the
most difficult problems of internationalization.  Java
1.1, however, solves this problem quite elegantly and hides
the difficult issues.  Java uses Unicode internally, so
it can represent essentially any character in any commonly
used written language.  As noted above, the remaining task
is to convert Unicode to and from locale-specific encodings.
Java 1.1 includes quite a few internal "byte-to-char"
converters and "char-to-byte" converters that handle
converting locale-specific character encodings to
Unicode and vice versa.  While the converters themselves are
not public, they are accessed through the
InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter
classes, which are two of the new character streams included
in the java.io package.
Any program can automatically handle locale-specific
encodings simply by using these new character stream classes
to do their textual input and output.  (And in addition to
automatic encoding conversion, the program also benefits
from the greatly improved efficiency of these new classes
over the byte streams of Java 1.0.)
Example 11.1
shows a simple program that works with character encodings.
It converts a file from one specified encoding to another by
converting from the first encoding to Unicode and then from
Unicode to the second encoding.  Note that most of the
program is taken up with the mechanics of parsing argument
lists, handling exceptions, and so on.  Only a few lines are
required to create the InputStreamReader and
OutputStreamWriter classes that perform the two
halves of the conversion.  Also note that exceptions are
handled by calling LocalizedError.display().  This
method is not part of the Java 1.1 API; it is a custom
method shown in Example 11.6
at the end of this chapter.
Example 11.1: Working with Character Encodings
import java.io.*;
/** A program to convert from one character encoding to another. */
public class ConvertEncoding {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String from = null, to = null;
    String infile = null, outfile = null;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {  // Parse command-line arguments.
      if (i == args.length-1) usage();      // All legal args require another.
      if (args[i].equals("-from")) from = args[++i];
      else if (args[i].equals("-to")) to = args[++i];
      else if (args[i].equals("-in")) infile = args[++i];
      else if (args[i].equals("-out")) outfile = args[++i];
      else usage();
    }
    try { convert(infile, outfile, from, to); }  // Attempt conversion.
    catch (Exception e) {                        // Handle possible exceptions.
      LocalizedError.display(e);  // Defined at the end of this chapter.
      System.exit(1);
    }
  }
  public static void usage() {
    System.err.println("Usage: java ConvertEncoding &lt;options&gt;\n" +
                       "Options:\n\t-from &lt;encoding&gt;\n\t-to &lt;encoding&gt;\n\t" +
                       "-in &lt;file&gt;\n\t-out &lt;file&gt;");
    System.exit(1);
  }
  public static void convert(String infile, String outfile,
                             String from, String to)
       throws IOException, UnsupportedEncodingException
  {
    // Set up byte streams.
    InputStream in;
    if (infile != null) in = new FileInputStream(infile);
    else in = System.in;
    OutputStream out;
    if (outfile != null) out = new FileOutputStream(outfile);
    else out = System.out;
    // Use default encoding if no encoding is specified.
    if (from == null) from = System.getProperty("file.encoding");
    if (to == null) to = System.getProperty("file.encoding");
    // Set up character streams.
    Reader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in, from));
    Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, to));
    // Copy characters from input to output.  The InputStreamReader converts
    // from the input encoding to Unicode, and the OutputStreamWriter converts
    // from Unicode to the output encoding.  Characters that cannot be
    // represented in the output encoding are output as '?'
    char[] buffer = new char[4096];
    int len;
    while((len = r.read(buffer)) != -1)  // Read a block of input.
      w.write(buffer, 0, len);           // And write it out.
    r.close();                           // Close the input.
    w.flush();                           // Flush and close output.
    w.close();
  }
