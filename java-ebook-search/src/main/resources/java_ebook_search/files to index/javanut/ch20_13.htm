20.13 java.awt.event.FocusListener (JDK 1.1)
This interface defines the methods that an object must
implement to "listen" for focus events on AWT components.
When a FocusEvent occurs, an AWT component
notifies its registered FocusListener objects by
invoking one of their methods.
An easy way to implement this interface is by subclassing
the FocusAdapter class.
public abstract interface FocusListener extends EventListener {
    // Public Instance Methods
            public abstract void focusGained(FocusEvent e);
            public abstract void focusLost(FocusEvent e);
}
