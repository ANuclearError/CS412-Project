20.20 java.awt.event.MouseAdapter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a trivial implementation of
MouseListener; it provides empty bodies for each
of the methods of that interface.  When you are not
interested in all of these methods, it is often easier to
subclass MouseAdapter than it is to implement
MouseListener from scratch.
public abstract class MouseAdapter extends Object implements MouseListener {
    // Default Constructor: public MouseAdapter()
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseListener
            public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseListener
            public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseListener
            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseListener
            public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseListener
}
