Example 1-2Scribble.java:
an applet of intermediate complexity, used as an example in the
introductory chapter.
Example 2-3throwtest.java:
an application that demonstrates how to define, throw, and handle
exceptions. This application doesn't do anything other than print out
some text, but you might want to study it and play around with it to
learn more about how exceptions work in Java. See the usage instructions
in the source code.
Example 6-1FirstApplet.java:
the simplest possible applet.  Displays "Hello World"
Example 6-2SecondApplet.java:
a fancier version of "Hello World"
Example 6-3Scribble.java:
a simple applet with user interaction.  It allows the user to click and
scribble in the window.
Example 6-4ColorScribble.java:
the scribble applet, with colors specified through applet parameters in
an HTML file.
Example 6-5Soundmap.java:
An applet that displays an image, plays a sound, and demonstrates

Example 7-1Scribble1.java:
a simple applet, using the Java 1.0 event model.
Example 7-2Scribble2.java:
the same applet, using the Java 1.1 event model.
Example 7-3Scribble3.java:
the applet using the Java 1.1 event model and inner classes.
Example 7-4Scribble4.java:
the applet using a low-level interface to the Java 1.1 event model.
Example 8-1ScribbleFrame.java:
a relatively long application that demonstrates many of the new AWT
features of Java 1.1, and also demonstrates object serialization and
data compression.
Example 9-2IntList.java:
a simple datatype that defines custom serialziation and de-serialization
behavior for itself.
Example 10-1MultiLineLabel.java:
a custom AWT component and Java Bean that displays a specified string of
text, using multiple lines, if the string contains newline characters.
Example 10-2YesNoDialog.java:
a bean that displays a dialog box.
Example 10-3AnswerEvent.java:
an event type used by the bean.
Example 10-4AnswerListener.java:
the event listener interface used by the bean
Example 10-5YesNoDialogBeanInfo.java:
a BeanInfo class for the bean.
Example 10-6YesNoDialogAlignmentEditor.java:
a property editor class for one of the bean's properties.
Example 10-7YesNoDialogMessageEditor.java:
a property editor class for another of the bean's properties.
Example 10-8YesNoDialogCustomizer.java:
a customizer class for the bean.
Example 11-1ConvertEncoding.java:
an application that converts a file from one character encoding to another.
Example 11-3Portfolio.java:

object, using the MessageFormat class.
Example 11-7Errors.properties:
a sample property file used by the previous example
Example 12-1ShowClass.java:
a program that uses the Reflection API to show the fields and methods of
a class.
Example 12-2UniversalActionListener.java:
an ActionListener implementation that uses reflection to invoke a named
method of an object.
