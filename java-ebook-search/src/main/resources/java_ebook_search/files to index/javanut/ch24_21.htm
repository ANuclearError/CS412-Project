24.21 java.io.FileReader (JDK 1.1)
FileReader is a convenience subclass of
InputStreamReader that is useful when you want to
read text (as opposed to binary data) from a file.  You
create a FileReader by specifying the file to be
read, in any of three possible forms.  The
FileReader constructor internally creates a
FileInputStream to read bytes from the specified
file, and uses the functionality of its superclass,
InputStreamReader, to convert those bytes from
characters in the local encoding to the Unicode characters
used by Java.
Because FileReader is a trivial subclass of
InputStreamReader, it does not define any
read() methods or other methods of its own.
Instead, it inherits all its methods from its superclass.
If you want to read Unicode characters from a file that uses
some encoding other than the default encoding for the
locale, you must explicitly create your own
InputStreamReader to perform the byte-to-character
conversion.
public class FileReader extends InputStreamReader {
    // Public Constructors
            public FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException;
            public FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException;
            public FileReader(FileDescriptor fd);
}
