[Chapter 4] 4.10 Enterprise APIs: JDBC, RMI, and Security
Chapter 4What's New in Java 1.1
4.10 Enterprise APIs: JDBC, RMI, and Security
Java 1.1 provides a number of important new features that
are loosely grouped under the name "Enterprise APIs."  These
include JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity), RMI (Remote
Method Invocation), and Java Security.  With release 1.1,
Java has grown too big for all of it to be documented, even
in quick-reference format, in a single volume.  Therefore,
the JDBC, RMI, and Security packages will be documented,
along with other, forthcoming Enterprise APIs, in a separate
volume, Java Enterprise in a Nutshell.  Note, however,
that while this volume does not cover the Java Security API,
it does cover applet security, signed applets, and the
javakey program that is used to create digital
signatures, generate key pairs, and manage a database of
entities and their keys.
