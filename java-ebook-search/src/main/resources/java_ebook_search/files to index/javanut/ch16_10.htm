Name
native2ascii---Convert Java source code to ASCII
Availability
JDK 1.1 and later.
Synopsis
native2ascii [ options ] [ inputfile [ outputfile ]]
Description
javac can only process files encoded in ASCII,
with any other characters encoded using the
\uxxxx Unicode notation.
native2ascii is a simple program that reads a
Java source file encoded using a local encoding and converts it to the
ASCII-plus-encoded-Unicode form required by
javac.
The inputfile and outputfile are optional.
If unspecified, standard input and standard output are
used, making native2ascii suitable for use in
pipes.
Options
-encoding encoding-name
Specifies the encoding used by source files.  If this option
is not specified, the encoding is taken from the
file.encoding system property.
-reverse
Specifies that the conversion should be done in
reverse--from encoded \uxxxx
characters to characters in the native encoding.
