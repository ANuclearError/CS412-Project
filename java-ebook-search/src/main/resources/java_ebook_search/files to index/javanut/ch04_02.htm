Chapter 4What's New in Java 1.1
4.2 Inner Classes
While the bulk of the changes in Java 1.1 are additions to
the core Java API, there has also been a major addition to
the language itself.  The language has been
extended to allow class definitions to be nested within
other classes, and even to be defined locally, within blocks
of code.  Altogether, there are four new types of classes
that can be defined in Java 1.1; these four new types
are sometimes loosely referred to as "inner classes."
Chapter 5, Inner Classes and Other New Language Features
explains in detail how to define and use each of the four
new types of classes.  As we'll see, inner classes are
useful primarily for defining simple "helper" or "adaptor"
classes that serve a very specific function at a particular
place in a program, and are not intended to be
general-purpose "top-level" classes.  By using inner classes
nested within other classes, you can place the definition of
these special-purpose helper classes closer to where they
are actually used in your programs.  This makes your code
clearer, and also prevents you from cluttering up the
package namespace with small special purpose classes that
are not of interest to programmers using your package.
We'll also see that inner classes are particularly useful
in conjunction with the new AWT event model in Java 1.1.
One important feature of inner classes is that no changes to
the Java Virtual Machine are required to support them.
When a Java 1.1 compiler encounters an inner class, it
transforms the Java 1.1 source code in a way that converts
the nested class to a regular top-level class.  Once that
transformation has been performed, the code can be compiled
just as it would have been in Java 1.0.
