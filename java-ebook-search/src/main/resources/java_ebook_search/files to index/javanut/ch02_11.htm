Chapter 2How Java Differs from C
2.11 Operators
Java supports almost all of the standard C operators.  These
standard operators have the same precedence and
associativity in Java as they do in C.  They are listed in
Table 2.3
and also in quick reference form in Chapter 13, Java Syntax.

Note the following Java operator differences from C. Java
does not support the comma operator for combining two
expressions into one (although the for statement
simulates this operator in a useful way).  
Since Java does not allow you to
manipulate pointers directly, it does not support the
reference and dereference operators *, -&gt;, and &amp;,
nor the sizeof operator.  Further, Java doesn't
consider [] (array access) and . (field
access) to be operators, as C does.
Java also adds some new operators:
The + operator applied to String values
concatenates them.
[5]
If only one operand of + is a
String, the other one is converted to a string.
The conversion is done automatically for primitive types,
and by calling the toString() method of non-primitive
types.  This String + operator has the same
precedence as the arithmetic + operator.  The
+= operator works as you would expect for
String values.
[5] 
To C++ programmers, this looks like operator
overloading.  In fact, Java does not support operator
overloading--the language designers decided (after much
debate) that overloaded operators were a neat idea, but that
code that relied on them became hard to read and understand.
The instanceof operator returns true if the
object o on its left-hand side is an instance of the
class C or implements the interface I
specified on its right-hand side.  It also returns
true if o is an instance of a subclass of
C or is an instance of a subclass of some class that
implements I.  instanceof returns
false if o is not an instance of C
or does not implement I.  It also returns
false if the value on its left is null.  If
instanceof returns true, it means that
o is assignable to variables of type C
or I.  The instanceof operator has the same
precedence as the &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and
&gt;= operators.
Because all integral types in Java are signed values, the
Java &gt;&gt; operator is defined to do a right shift with
sign extension.  The &gt;&gt;&gt; operator treats the value
to be shifted as an unsigned number and shifts the bits
right with zero extension.  The &gt;&gt;&gt;= operator works
as you would expect.
&amp; and |
When &amp; and | are applied to integral types
in Java, they perform the expected bitwise AND and OR
operations.  Java makes a strong distinction between
integral types and the boolean type, however.  Thus,
if these operators are applied to boolean types,
they perform logical AND and logical OR operations.  These
logical AND and logical OR operators always evaluate both of
their operands, even when the result of the operation is
determined after evaluating only the left operand.  This is
useful when the operands are expressions with side effects
(such as method calls) and you always want the side effects
to occur.  However, when you do not want the right operand
evaluated if it is not necessary, you can use the &amp;&amp;
and || operators, which perform "short-circuited" logical AND and
logical OR operations just as in C.  The &amp;= and
|= operators perform a bitwise or logical operation
depending on the type of the operands, as you would
expect.
