18.51 java.awt.PrintJob (JDK 1.1)
A PrintJob object represents a single printing
session or "job."  The job may consist of one or more
individual pages.
PrintJob is abstract so it cannot be instantiated
directly.  Instead, you must call the getPrintJob()
method of the Toolkit object.  Calling this method
posts an appropriate print dialog box to request
information from the user, such as which printer should be
used.  An application has no control over this process, but
may pass a Properties object in which the dialog
stores the user's printing preferences.  This
Properties object can then be reused when initiating
subsequent print jobs.
Once a PrintJob object has been obtained from the
Toolkit object, you call the
getGraphics() method of PrintJob to obtain a
Graphics object.  Any drawing done with this
Graphics object is printed rather than being
displayed on-screen.  The object
returned by getGraphics() implements the
PrintGraphics interface.  Do not make any
assumptions about the initial state of the Graphics
object; in particular note that you must specify a font
before you can draw any text.
When you are done drawing all the desired output on a page, 
call the dispose() method of the
Graphics object to force the current page to be
printed.  You can call PrintJob.getGraphics() and
Graphics.dispose() repeatedly to print any number of
pages required by your application.  Note, however, that if
the lastPageFirst() method returns true,
the user has requested that pages be printed in reverse
order.  It is up to your application to implement this
feature.
The getPageDimension() method returns the size of
the page in pixels.  getPageResolution() returns the
resolution of the page in pixels per inch.  This resolution
is closer to a screen resolution (70 to 100 pixels per
inch) rather than a typical printer resolution (300 to 600
pixels per inch).  This means that on-screen drawings can be
drawn directly to the printer without scaling.  It also
means, however, that you cannot take full advantage of the
extra resolution provided by printers.
When you are done with a PrintJob, and you have called
dispose() on the Graphics object returned by
getGraphics(), you should call end() to
terminate the job.
