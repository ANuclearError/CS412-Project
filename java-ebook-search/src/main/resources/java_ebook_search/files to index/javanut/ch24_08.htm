24.8 java.io.CharArrayWriter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a character output stream that uses an
internal character array as the destination of characters
written to it.  When you create a CharArrayWriter,
you may optionally specify an initial size for the character
array, but you do not specify the character array
itself--this array is managed internally by the
CharArrayWriter, and grows as necessary to
accommodate all the characters written to it.  The
toString() and toCharArray() methods return
a copy of all characters written to the stream, either as a
string or as an array of characters.
CharArrayWriter defines the standard
write(), flush(), and close() methods
that all Writer subclasses do.  It also defines a
few other useful methods.  size() returns the number
of characters that have been written to the stream.
reset() resets the stream to its initial state, with
an empty character array; this is more efficient than
creating a new CharArrayWriter.  Finally,
writeTo() writes the contents of the internal
character array to some other specified character stream.
CharArrayWriter is the character-stream analog of
ByteArrayOutputStream, and is quite similar to
StringWriter.
public class CharArrayWriter extends Writer {
    // Public Constructors
            public CharArrayWriter();
            public CharArrayWriter(int initialSize);
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected char[] buf;
            protected int count;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close();  // Defines Writer
            public void flush();  // Defines Writer
            public void reset();

            public void write(int c);  // Overrides Writer
            public void write(char[] c, int off, int len);  // Defines Writer
            public void write(String str, int off, int len);  // Overrides Writer
            public void writeTo(Writer out) throws IOException;
