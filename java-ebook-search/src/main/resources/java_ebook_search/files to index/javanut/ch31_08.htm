31.8 java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream (JDK 1.1)
This class is a subclass of
java.io.FilterOutputStream; it "filters" a stream of
data by compressing ("deflating") it and then writes the
compressed data to another output stream.  To create a
DeflaterOutputStream, you must specify the stream
that it is to write to, and also a Deflater object
that is to perform the compression.  You can set various
options on the Deflater object to specify just what
type of compression is to be performed.  Once a
DeflaterOutputStream is created, its write()
and close() methods are the same as those of other
output streams.
The InflaterInputStream class can be used to read data
written with the DeflaterOutputStream.
Note that a DeflaterOutputStream writes raw
compressed data; applications often prefer one of its
subclasses, GZIPOutputStream or
ZipOutputStream, which wraps the raw compressed data
within a standard file format.
public class DeflaterOutputStream extends FilterOutputStream {
    // Public Constructors
            public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out, Deflater def, int size);
            public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out, Deflater def);
            public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out);
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected byte[] buf;
            protected Deflater def;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
            public void finish() throws IOException;
            public void write(int b) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
            public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
    // Protected Instance Methods
            protected void deflate() throws IOException;
