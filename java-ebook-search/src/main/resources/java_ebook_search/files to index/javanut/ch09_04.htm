9.4 Serialized Applets
One of the uses of object serialization in Java 1.1 is for
serialized applets.  As discussed in Chapter 15, Java-Related HTML Tags,
the &lt;APPLET&gt; 
tag has a
new attribute, OBJECT, that can be used in place of
the CODE attribute to specify a serialized object file instead
of a class file.  When such an &lt;APPLET&gt;
tag is encountered, the applet viewer or Web browser
creates the applet by deserializing it.
The reason that this is an interesting thing to do is that
it allows an applet to be shipped in a pre-initialized
state.  The code for the applet need not even include the
code that performed the initialization.  For example,
imagine a GUI builder tool that allows a programmer to build
a GUI using a point-and-click interface.  Such a tool could
create a tree of AWT components within an Applet panel, and
then serialize the applet, including all of the GUI
components it contains.  When deserialized, the applet would
have a complete GUI, despite the fact that the applet's
class file does not contain any code to create the GUI.
You can experiment with applet serialization with the JDK
1.1 appletviewer program.  Start an applet running in
appletviewer in the usual way.  This loads the
applet and runs its init() and start()
methods.  Next, select the Stop item from the menu to
stop the applet.  Now use the Save menu item to
serialize the applet to a file.  By convention, your
serialized applet file should be given a .ser
extension.  If the applet refers to any non-serializable
objects, you may not be able to serialize it.  For example,
you may encounter problems serializing applets that use
threads or images.
Once you have serialized an applet, create an HTML file with
an &lt;APPLET&gt; tag something like this:
&lt;APPLET OBJECT="MyApplet.ser" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=200&gt;&lt;/APPLET &gt;
Finally, you can use appletviewer with this new HTML file.  It
should deserialize and display the applet.  When created in
this way, the applet's init() method is not called
(since it was called before serialization), but its
start() method is called (because the applet should
have been stopped before serialization).
