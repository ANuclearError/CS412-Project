25.49 java.lang.Process (JDK 1.0)
This class describes a process that is running externally to
the Java interpreter. Note that a Process is a very
different thing than a Thread.  The Process
class is abstract and may not be instantiated.  Call one of
the Runtime.exec() methods to start a process and
return a corresponding Process object.  
waitFor() blocks until the Process exits.
exitValue() returns the exit code of the process.
destroy() kills the process.
getInputStream() returns an InputStream from
which you can read any bytes the process sends to its
standard error stream.  getErrorStream() returns
an InputStream from which you can read any bytes
the process sends to its standard output stream.
getOutputStream() returns an OutputStream
that you can use to send bytes to the standard input stream
of the process.
public abstract class Process extends Object {
    // Default Constructor: public Process()
    // Public Instance Methods

            public abstract int exitValue();
            public abstract InputStream getErrorStream();
            public abstract InputStream getInputStream();
            public abstract OutputStream getOutputStream();
            public abstract int waitFor() throws InterruptedException;
