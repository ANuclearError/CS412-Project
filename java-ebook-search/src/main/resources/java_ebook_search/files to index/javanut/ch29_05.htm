CollationKey objects are used to compare strings
more quickly than is possible with Collation.compare().  Objects of this class are
returned by Collation.getCollationKey().  To compare
two CollationKey objects, invoke the
compareTo() method of key A, passing
the key B as an
argument (both CollationKey objects must be created
through the same Collation object).  The return
value of this method is less than zero if the key A is
collated before the key B.  It is equal to zero if they are
equivalent for the purposes of collation, and it is greater
than zero if the key A is collated after the key B.
Use getSourceString() to obtain the string
represented by a CollationKey.
