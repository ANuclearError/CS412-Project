25.47 java.lang.Object (JDK 1.0)
This is the root class in Java. All classes are subclasses
of Object, and thus all objects can invoke the
public and protected methods of this class.
equals() tests whether two objects have the same
value (i.e., not whether two variables refer to the same
object, but whether two distinct objects have byte-for-byte equivalence).
For classes that implement the Cloneable
interface, clone() makes a byte-for-byte copy of an
Object. getClass() returns the
Class object associated with any Object, and
the notify(), notifyAll(), and
wait() methods are used for thread synchronization
on a given Object.
A number of these Object methods should be
overridden by subclasses of Object. Subclasses
should provide their own definition of the
toString() method so that they can be used with the
string concatenation operator and with the
PrintWriter.println() methods. Defining the
toString() method for all objects also helps with
debugging.
Classes that contain references to other objects may want to
override the equals() and clone() methods
(for Cloneable objects) so that they recursively
call the equals() and clone() methods of the
objects referred to within the original object.
Some classes, particularly those that override
equals(), may also want to override the
hashCode() method to provide an appropriate hashcode
to be used when storing instances in a
Hashtable data structure.
Classes that allocate system resources other than memory
(such as file descriptors or windowing system graphic
contexts) should override the finalize() method to
release these resources when the object is no longer
referred to and is about to be garbage collected.
