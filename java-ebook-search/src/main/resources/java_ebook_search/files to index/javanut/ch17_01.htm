An applet is a
small, embeddable Java program.
The java.applet package is a small one.  It contains
the Applet class, which is the superclass of all
applets, and three related interfaces. 
Figure 17.1
shows the class hierarchy of this package.  See Chapter 6, Applets,
for more information about this package.

17.1 java.applet.Applet (JDK 1.0)
This class implements an applet.  To create your own applet,
you should create a subclass of this class and override some
or all of the following methods.  Note that you never need
to call these methods--they are called when appropriate
by a Web browser or other applet viewer.
init() should perform any initialization for the
applet; it is called when the applet first starts.
destroy() should free up any resources that the
applet is holding; it is called when the applet is about to be
permanently stopped. start() is called to make the applet start doing
whatever it is that it does.  Often, it starts a thread to
perform an animation or similar task.  stop() should
temporarily stop the applet from executing.  It is called
when the applet temporarily becomes hidden or non-visible.
getAppletInfo()
should return text suitable for display in an About
dialog posted by the Web browser or applet viewer.
getParameterInfo()
should return an arbitrary-length array of three-element arrays
of strings where each element
describes one of the parameters that this applet
understands.  The three elements of each parameter
description are strings that specify, respectively, the
parameter's name, type, and description.
In addition to these methods, an applet also typically
overrides several of the methods of
java.awt.Component, notably the paint()
method to draw the applet on the screen.  There are also
several Applet methods that you do not override but
may call from applet code: showStatus()
displays text in the Web browser or applet viewer's status
line.  getImage()
and getAudioClip()
read image (GIF and JPEG formats) and audio files (AU
format) over the network and return corresponding Java
objects.  getParameter()
looks up the value of a parameter specified with a
&lt;PARAM&gt; tag within an &lt;APPLET&gt;...&lt;/APPLET&gt;
pair.  getCodeBase()
returns the base URL from which the applet's code was
loaded, and getDocumentBase()
returns the base URL from which the HTML document containing
the applet was loaded.  getAppletContext()
returns an AppletContext object, which also has
useful methods.
public class Applet extends Panel {
    // Default Constructor: public Applet()
    // Public Instance Methods

            public URL getDocumentBase();

            public void play(URL url, String name);
            public void resize(int width, int height);  // Overrides Component
            public void resize(Dimension d);  // Overrides Component
            public final void setStub(AppletStub stub);
            public void showStatus(String msg);
            public void start();
            public void stop();
