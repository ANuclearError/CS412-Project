18.61 java.awt.Window (JDK 1.0)
This class represents a top-level window with no
borders or menu bar.  Window is a Container
with BorderLayout as its default layout manager.
Window is rarely used directly; its subclasses
Frame and Dialog are more commonly useful.
show() (which overrides Component.show())
makes a Window visible and brings it to the front of
other windows. toFront() brings a window to the
front, and toBack() buries a window beneath others.
pack() is an important method that 
initiates layout management for the window, and sets the window
size to match the preferred size of the components contained
within the window.  getToolkit() returns the
Toolkit() in use for this window.  Call
dispose() when a Window is no longer needed
to free its window system resources.
