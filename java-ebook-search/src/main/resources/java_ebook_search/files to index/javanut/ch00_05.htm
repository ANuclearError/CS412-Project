Preface
Java in a Nutshell Web Sites
The Web site for this book is
http://www.ora.com/catalog/books/javanut2/.  There you
will find the examples from this book, available for
download.  As typos are reported, you may also find an
errata list at that Web site.
My personal Web site is http://www.DavidFlanagan.COM/.
This is a new site, just getting off the ground as this book
goes to press, but it will eventually contain a number of
Java programming resources, including commercial and
shareware tools and "beans" that I have written.
