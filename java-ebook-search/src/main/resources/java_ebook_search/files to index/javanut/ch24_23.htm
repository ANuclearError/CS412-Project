24.23 java.io.FilenameFilter (JDK 1.0)
This interface defines the accept() method that must
be implemented by any object that filters filenames
(i.e., selects a subset of filenames from a list of
filenames). There are no standard FilenameFilter
classes implemented by Java, but objects that implement this
interface are used by the java.awt.FileDialog
object, and by the File.list() method. A typical
FilenameFilter object might check that the specified
File represents a file (not a directory), is
readable (and possibly writable as well), and that its name
ends with some desired extension.
