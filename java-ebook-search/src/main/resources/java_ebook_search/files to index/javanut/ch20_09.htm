Chapter 20The java.awt.event Package
20.9 java.awt.event.ContainerEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type serves as notification that the source
Container has had a child added to it or removed from
it.  Note that this event is a notification only; the AWT
adds or removes the child internally, and the recipient of
this event need take no action itself.
getChild() returns the child Component that
was added or removed, and getContainer() returns the
Container that it was added to or removed from.
getContainer() is simply a convenient alternative to
getSource().
getID() returns the constant COMPONENT_ADDED
or COMPONENT_REMOVED to indicate whether the
specified child was added or removed.
public class ContainerEvent extends ComponentEvent {
    // Public Constructor

            public Container getContainer();
            public String paramString();  // Overrides ComponentEvent
