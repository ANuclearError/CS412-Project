10.4 Custom Events
Beans can use the standard AWT event
types defined in the java.awt.event package, but
they do not have to.  Our
YesNoDialog class defines its own event type,
AnswerEvent.  Defining a new event class is really quite
simple; AnswerEvent is shown in
Example 10.3.
Example 10.3: The AnswerEvent Class
package oreilly.beans.yesno;
public class AnswerEvent extends java.util.EventObject {
  protected int id;
  public static final int YES = 0, NO = 1, CANCEL = 2;
  public AnswerEvent(Object source, int id) {
    super(source);
    this.id = id;
  }
  public int getID() { return id; }
}
Along with the AnswerEvent class,
YesNoDialog also defines a new type of event
listener interface, ActionListener, that
defines the methods that must be implemented by any object
that wants to receive notification from a
YesNoDialog.  The definition of AnswerListener is
shown in Example 10.4.
Example 10.4: The AnswerListener Interface
package oreilly.beans.yesno;
public interface AnswerListener extends java.util.EventListener {
  public void yes(AnswerEvent e);
  public void no(AnswerEvent e);
  public void cancel(AnswerEvent e);
}
