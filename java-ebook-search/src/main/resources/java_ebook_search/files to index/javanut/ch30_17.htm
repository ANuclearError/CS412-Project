30.17 java.util.Properties (JDK 1.0)
This class is an extension of Hashtable that allows
key/value pairs to be read from and written to a stream.
The Properties class is used to implement the system
properties list, which supports user customization by
allowing programs to look up the value of named resources.
When you create a Properties object, you may specify
another Properties object that contains default
values. Keys (property names) and values are associated in
a Properties object with the Hashtable
method put(). Values are looked up with
getProperty()--if this method does not find the key
in the current Properties object, it looks in
the default Properties object that was passed to the
constructor method. A default value may also be specified
in case the key is not found at all.
propertyNames() returns an enumeration of all
property names (keys) stored in the Properties
object and (recursively) also all property names stored in
the default Properties object associated with it.
list() prints the properties stored in a
Properties object. It is useful for debugging.
save() writes a Properties object to a
stream. load() reads key/value pairs from a stream
and stores them in a Properties object.
