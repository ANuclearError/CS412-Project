Reading a Quick Reference Entry
The quick-reference section that follows packs a lot of
information into a small space.  This introduction explains
how to get the most out of that information.  It explains
how the quick reference is organized and how to read the
individual quick-ref entries.
5.1 Finding a Quick Reference Entry
The following chapters each document one package of the Java
API.  The packages are listed alphabetically, beginning with
java.applet and ending with java.util.zip.
Each chapter begins with an overview of the package,
including a hierarchy diagram for the classes and interfaces
in the package.  Within each chapter, the classes and
interfaces of a package are themselves listed
alphabetically.
If you know the name of a class, but not of the package that
it is a part of, or if you
know the name of a method or field, but do not know what
class defines it, use the index in Chapter 32, Class, Method, and Field Index
to find the information you need.
