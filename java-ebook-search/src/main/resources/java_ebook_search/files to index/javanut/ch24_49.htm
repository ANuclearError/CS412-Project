24.49 java.io.PipedOutputStream (JDK 1.0)
This class is an OutputStream that implements one half 
of a pipe, and is useful for communication between
threads. A PipedOutputStream must be connected to a
PipedInputStream, which may be specified when the
PipedOutputStream is created or with the
connect() method. Data written to the
PipedOutputStream are available for reading on
the PipedInputStream.
See OutputStream for information on the low-level
methods for writing data to a PipedOutputStream. A
FilterOutputStream may be used to provide a
higher-level interface for writing data to a
PipedOutputStream.
public class PipedOutputStream extends OutputStream {
    // Public Constructors
            public PipedOutputStream(PipedInputStream snk) throws IOException;
            public PipedOutputStream();
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Overrides OutputStream
            public void connect(PipedInputStream snk) throws IOException;
            public synchronized void flush() throws IOException;  // Overrides OutputStream
            public void write(int b) throws IOException;  // Defines OutputStream
            public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides OutputStream
