24.64 java.io.StringWriter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a character output stream that uses an
internal StringBuffer object as the destination of
the characters written to the stream.  When you create a
StringWriter, you may optionally specify an initial
size for the StringBuffer, but you do not specify
the StringBuffer itself--it is managed internally
by the StringWriter, and grows as necessary to
accommodate the characters written to it.
StringWriter defines the standard write(),
flush(), and close() methods that all
Writer subclasses do, and also defines two methods
to obtain the characters that have been written into the
stream's internal buffer.  toString() returns the
contents of the internal buffer as a String, and
getBuffer() returns the buffer itself.  Note that
getBuffer() returns a reference to the actual
internal buffer, not a copy of it, so any changes you make
to the buffer are reflected in subsequent calls to
toString(). 
StringWriter is quite similar to
CharArrayWriter, but does not have a byte stream
analog.
public class StringWriter extends Writer {
    // Public Constructor
            public StringWriter();
    // Protected Constructor
            protected StringWriter(int initialSize);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close();  // Defines Writer
            public void flush();  // Defines Writer
            public StringBuffer getBuffer();
            public String toString();  // Overrides Object
            public void write(int c);  // Overrides Writer
            public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len);  // Defines Writer
            public void write(String str);  // Overrides Writer
            public void write(String str, int off, int len);  // Overrides Writer
}
