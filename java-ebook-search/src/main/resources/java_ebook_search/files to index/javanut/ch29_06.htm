29.6 java.text.Collator (JDK 1.1)
This class is used to compare, order, and sort strings in a
way that is appropriate for the default locale or some other
specified locale.  Because it is an abstract class, it
cannot be instantiated directly.  Instead, you must use the
static getInstance() method to obtain an instance of
a Collator subclass that is appropriate for the
default or specified locale.  You can use
getAvailableLocales() to determine whether a
Collator object is available for a desired locale.
Once an appropriate Collator object has been
obtained, you can use the compare() method to
compare strings.  The possible return values of this method
are -1, 0, and 1, which indicate, respectively, that the
first string is collated before the second, that the two are
equivalent for collation purposes, and that the first string
is collated after the second.  The equals() method
is a convenient shortcut for testing two strings for
collation equivalence.
When sorting an array of strings, each string in the array
is typically compared more than once.  Using the
compare() method in this case is inefficient. A
more efficient method for comparing strings multiple times is to use
getCollationKey() for each string to create
CollationKey objects.  These objects can then be
compared to each other more quickly than the strings
themselves could be compared.
You can customize the way the Collator object
performs comparisons by calling setStrength().  If
you pass the constant PRIMARY to this method,
the comparison only looks at primary differences in the
strings--it compares letters but ignores accents and case
differences.  If you pass the constant SECONDARY,
it ignores case differences but does not ignore
accents.  And if you pass TERTIARY (the default), the
Collator object takes both accents and case
differences into account in its comparison.
