30.18 java.util.PropertyResourceBundle (JDK 1.1)
This class is a concrete subclass of ResourceBundle.
It reads a Properties file from a specified
InputStream and implements the
ResourceBundle API for looking up named resources
from the resulting Properties object.
A Properties file contains lines of the form:
name=value
Each such line defines a named property with the specified
String value.
Although you can instantiate a
PropertyResourceBundle yourself, it is more common
to simply define a Properties file, and then allow
ResourceBundle.getBundle() to look up that file and
return the necessary PropertyResourceBundle object.
See also Properties and ResourceBundle.

    // Public Instance Methods
            public Enumeration getKeys();  // Defines ResourceBundle
            public Object handleGetObject(String key);  // Defines ResourceBundle
