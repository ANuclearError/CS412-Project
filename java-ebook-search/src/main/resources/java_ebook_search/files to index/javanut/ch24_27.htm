24.27 java.io.FilterWriter (JDK 1.1)
This abstract class is intended to act as a superclass for
character output streams that filter the data written to
them before writing it to some other character output
stream.
FilterWriter is declared abstract, so that
it cannot be instantiated.  But none of its methods are
themselves abstract: they all simply invoke the
corresponding method on the output stream that was passed to
the FilterWriter constructor.  If you were allowed to
instantiate a FilterWriter object, you'd find that it
acts as a "null filter"--that it simply passes the
characters written to it along, without any filtration.
Because FilterWriter implements a "null filter," it
is an ideal superclass for classes that want to implement
simple filters without having to override all of the methods
of Writer.  In order to create your own filtered
character output stream, you should subclass
FilterWriter and override all of its write()
methods to perform the desired filtering operation.  Note
that you can implement two of the write() methods in
terms of the third, and thus only implement your filtering
algorithm once.  In some cases, you may want to override
other Writer methods as well, and you may often want
to add other methods or constructors that are specific to
your subclass.
FilterWriter is the character-stream analog of
FilterOutputStream. 
public abstract class FilterWriter extends Writer {
    // Protected Constructor
            protected FilterWriter(Writer out);
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected Writer out;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void flush() throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void write(int c) throws IOException;  // Overrides Writer
            public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void write(String str, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides Writer
}
