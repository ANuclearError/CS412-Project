Acknowledgments
This handbook is a desktop quick reference for Java
programmers; it covers version 1.1 of the Java language and API.
It also includes introductory and tutorial
material for C and C++ programmers who want to learn Java.
It was written to sit faithfully by your keyboard for easy
reference while you program.  The wild success of the first
edition has shown that this is exactly what Java programmers
want, and I've retained the "no fluff" explanations and the
to-the-point reference material in this second edition.
I hope that new readers will find this book useful, and that
old readers will find it even more useful than the last one!
Contents of This Book
This book is divided into five parts:
Part I: Introducing Java
This first part of the book introduces Java and Java
programming, with a particular emphasis on helping C and C++
programmers make the transition to Java.  If you are already
familiar with Java 1.0 programming, you can skip the three
chapters in this part.
Part II: Introducing Java 1.1
This second part of the book contains two chapters that
introduce the new features of the Java 1.1 API
and the new language features in Java 1.1.
Part III: Programming with the Java 1.1 API
This part contains example programs that demonstrate many of
the new features of Java 1.1.  You may find that these
examples are a good starting point for your own programs,
and you should feel free to adapt them for your own use.  As
explained below, this example section has changed a lot
since the first edition of this book.
Part IV: Java Language Reference
This part of the book contains reference material that describes
the syntax of the Java language and the tools provided
with the Java Development Kit (JDK), among other things.
Part V: API Quick Reference
This part is a quick reference for the Java API; it forms
the bulk of the book.  Please be sure to read the How To Use
This Quick Reference material, which appears at the beginning of
the part.  It explains how to get the most out of the
reference material.
