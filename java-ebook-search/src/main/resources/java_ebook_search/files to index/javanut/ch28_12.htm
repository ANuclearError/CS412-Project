28.12 java.net.MulticastSocket (JDK 1.1)
This subclass of DatagramSocket is used to send and
receive multicast UDP packets.  It extends
DatagramSocket by adding joinGroup() and
leaveGroup() methods to join and leave multicast
groups.  The IP address specified to these methods should be
a valid multicast address in the range of 224.0.0.1 to
239.255.255.255.  Note that you do not have to join a group
to send a packet to a multicast address, but you must join
the group to receive packets sent to that address.
MulticastSocket defines a variant send()
method that allows you to specify a time-to-live (TTL) value for
the packet you send.  This value specifies the number of
network "hops" the packet may travel before it expires.
You can also set a default TTL for all packets sent though a
MulticastSocket with setTTL().
Note that untrusted applets are not allowed to use multicast
sockets.
