24.57 java.io.Reader (JDK 1.1)
This abstract class is the superclass of all character input
streams.  It is an analog to InputStream, which is
the superclass of all byte input streams.  Reader
defines the basic methods that all character output streams
provide.
read() returns a single character or an array (or
subarray) of characters, blocking if necessary.  It returns
-1 if the end of the stream has been reached.
ready() returns true if there are characters
available for reading.  If ready() returns
true, the next call to read() is
guaranteed not to block.  close() closes the
character input stream.  skip() skips a specified
number of characters in the input stream.  If
markSupported() returns true, then
mark() "marks" a position in the stream and, if
necessary, creates a look-ahead buffer of the specified size.
Future calls to reset() restore the stream to
the marked position, if they occur within the specified
look-ahead limit.  Note that not all stream  types support
this mark-and-reset functionality.
To create a subclass of Reader, you need only
implement the three-argument version of read() and
close().  Most subclasses implement additional
methods as well, however.
