3.3 Class Variables
In our Circle class definition, we declared three
"instance" variables: x, y, and r.  Each
instance of the class--each circle--has its own copy of
these three variables.  These variables are like the fields
of a struct in C--each instance of the
struct has a copy of the fields.  Sometimes,
though, we want a variable of which there is only one
copy--something like a global variable in C.
The problem is that Java doesn't allow global variables.
(Actually, those in the know consider this is feature!)
Every variable in Java must be declared inside a class.  
So Java uses the static keyword to indicate that a
particular variable is a class variable rather than an
instance variable.  That is, that there is only one
copy of the variable, associated with the class, rather than
many copies of the variable associated with each instance of
the class.  The one copy of the variable exists regardless
of the number of instances of the class that are created--it
exists and can be used even if the class is never actually
instantiated.
This kind of variable, declared with the static
keyword, is often called a static variable. I prefer
(and recommend) the name "class variable" because it is
easily distinguished from its opposite, "instance
variable." We'll use both terms in this book.
An Example
As an example (a somewhat contrived one), suppose that while
developing the Circle class we wanted to do some testing on
it and determine how much it gets used.  One way to do this
would be to count the number of Circle objects that
are instantiated.  To do this we obviously need a variable
associated with the class, rather than with any particular
instance.  
Example 3.4
shows how we can do it--we declare a static variable
and increment it each time we create a Circle.
Example 3.4: Static Variable Example
public class Circle {
    static int num_circles = 0; // class variable: how many circles created
    public double x, y, r;      // instance vars: the center and the radius
    public Circle(double x, double y, double r) {
        this.x = x; this.y = y; this.r = r;
        num_circles++;
    }
    public Circle(double r) { this(0.0, 0.0, r); }
    public Circle(Circle c) { this(c.x, c.y, c.r); }
    public Circle() { this(0.0, 0.0, 1.0); }
    public double circumference() { return 2 * 3.14159 * r; }
    public double area() { return 3.14159 * r*r; }
}
Accessing Class Variables
Now that we are keeping track of the number of Circle
objects created, how can we access this
information?  Because static variables are
associated with the class rather than with an instance, we
access them through the class rather than through the
instance.  Thus, we might write:
[5]
[5] 
Recall that System.out.println() prints a line of
text, and that the string concatenation operator, +,
converts non-string types to strings as necessary.
System.out.println("Number of circles created: " + Circle.num_circles);
Notice that in our definition of the constructor method in
Example 3.4,
we just used num_circles instead of
Circle.num_circles.  We're allowed to do this within
the class definition of Circle itself.  Anywhere
else, though, we must use the class name as well.
Global Variables?
Earlier we said that Java does not support global variables.
In a sense, though, Circle.num_circles behaves just
like one.  What is different from a global variable in C is
that there is no possibility of name conflicts.  If we use
some other class with a class variable named
num_circles, there won't be a "collision" between
these two "global" variables, because they must both be
referred to by their class names.  Since each class variable
must be part of a class and must be referred to with its
class name, each has a unique name.  Furthermore, each class
has a unique name because, as we saw in Chapter 2, How Java Differs from C, 
it is part of a package with a unique name.
Constants: Another Class Variable Example
Let's try a less forced example of why you might want to use
a class variable with the Circle class.  When
computing the area and circumference of circles, we use the
value pi.  Since we use the value frequently, we don't want 
to keep typing out 3.14159, so we'll define it as a class variable 
that has a convenient name:
public class Circle {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;
    public double x, y, r;
    // ... etc....
}
Besides the static keyword that we've already seen,
we use the final keyword, which means that this
variable can never have its value changed.  This prevents
you from doing something stupid like:
Circle.PI = 4;
which would tend to give you some pretty square-looking
circles. 
The Java compiler is smart about variables declared both
static and final--it knows that they have
constant values.  So when you write code like this:
double circumference = 2 * Circle.PI * radius;
the compiler precomputes the value 2 * Circle.PI
, instead of leaving it for the interpreter.
Java does not have a preprocessor with a C-style
#define directive.  static final
variables are Java's substitute for C's #define'd
constants.  Note that the C convention
of capitalizing constants has been carried over into Java.
