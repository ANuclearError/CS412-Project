28.3 java.net.ContentHandler (JDK 1.0)
This abstract class defines a method that reads data
from a URLConnection and returns an object
representing that data. Each subclass that implements this
method is responsible for handling a different type of
content (i.e., a different MIME type). Applications never
create ContentHandler objects directly--they are
created, when necessary, by the registered
ContentHandlerFactory object. Applications should
also never call ContentHandler methods
directly--they should call 
URL.getContent() or
URLConnection.getContent() instead. 
You only need to subclass ContentHandler if you
are writing a Web browser or similar application that
needs to parse and understand some new content type.
public abstract class ContentHandler extends Object {
    // Default Constructor: public ContentHandler()
    // Public Instance Methods
            public abstract Object getContent(URLConnection urlc) throws IOException;
