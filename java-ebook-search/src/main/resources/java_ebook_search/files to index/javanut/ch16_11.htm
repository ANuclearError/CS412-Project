Name
serialver---Class Version Number Generator
Availability
JDK 1.1 and later.
Synopsis
serialver [-show] classname...
Description
serialver displays the version number, or
serialization-unique identifier, for a named class or
classes.  If the class declares a long
serialVersionUID constant, the value of that field
is displayed.  Otherwise, a unique version number is
computed by applying the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to the
API defined by the class.  This program is primarily useful
for computing an initial unique version number for a class,
which is then declared as a constant in the class.  The
output of serialver is a line of legal Java code,
suitable for pasting into a class definition.
Options
-show
When the -show option is specified, serialver
displays a simple graphical interface that allows the user
to type in a single classname at a time and obtain its
serialization UID.  When using -show, no class names
may be specified on the command-line.
Environment
CLASSPATH
serialver is written in Java, and so it is sensitive
to the CLASSPATH environment variable in the same
way that the java interpreter is.  The specified
classes are looked up relative to this class path.
