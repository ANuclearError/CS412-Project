PopupMenu is a simple subclass of Menu that
represents a popup menu rather than a pulldown menu.  You
create a PopupMenu just as you would create a
Menu object.  The main difference is that a popup
menu must be "popped up" in response to a user event by
calling its show() method.
Another difference is that, unlike a Menu, which can
only appear within a MenuBar or another
Menu, a PopupMenu can be associated with any
component in a graphical user interface.  A PopupMenu is
associated with a component by calling the add()
method of the component.
Popup menus are popped up by the user in different ways on different
platforms.  In order to hide this platform-dependency, the
MouseEvent class defines the
isPopupTrigger() method.  If this method returns
true, the specified MouseEvent
represents the platform-specific popup menu trigger event,
and you should use the show() method to pop your
PopupMenu up.  Note that the X and Y coordinates
passed to show() should be in the coordinate system
of the specified Component.
public class PopupMenu extends Menu {
    // Public Constructors
            public PopupMenu();
            public PopupMenu(String label);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public synchronized void addNotify();  // Overrides Menu
            public void show(Component origin, int x, int y);
