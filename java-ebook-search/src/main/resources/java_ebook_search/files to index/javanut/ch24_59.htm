24.59 java.io.Serializable (JDK 1.1)
The Serializable interface defines no methods or
constants. A class should implement this interface simply
to indicate that it allows itself to be serialized
and deserialized with
ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() and
ObjectInputStream.readObject(). 
Objects that need special handling during
serialization or deserialization may implement one or both
of the following methods.  Note, however, that these methods
are not part of the Serializable interface:
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) 
                  throws IOException
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)
                    throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
Typically the writeObject() method performs any
necessary cleanup or preparation for serialization,
invokes the defaultWriteObject() method of the
ObjectOutputStream to serialize the
non-transient fields of the class, and then
optionally writes any additional data that are required.
Similarly, the readObject() method typically
invokes the defaultReadObject() method of the
ObjectInputStream, reads any additional data
written by the corresponding writeObject() method,
and finally performs any extra initialization required by the
object.  The readObject() method may also register
an ObjectInputValidation object to validate the
object once it is completely deserialized.
