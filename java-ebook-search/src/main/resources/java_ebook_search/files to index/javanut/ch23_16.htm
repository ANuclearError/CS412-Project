The PropertyEditor interface defines the methods
that must be implemented by a Java beans property editor
intended for use within an application builder or similar
tool.  PropertyEditor is a complex interface because
it defines methods to support several different ways of
displaying property values to the user, and it also defines
methods to support several different ways of allowing the
user to edit the property value.
For a property of type x, the author of a Java bean
typically implements a property editor of class
xEditor.  While the editor is implemented by
the bean author, it is usually only instantiated or used
by application builders or similar tools (or by a
Customizer class for a Bean).
In addition to implementing the PropertyEditor
interface, a property editor must have a constructor that
expects no arguments, so that it can be easily instantiated by an application builder.  Also, it must
accept registration and deregistration of
PropertyChangeListener objects, and it must send a
PropertyChangeEvent to all registered listeners when
it changes the value of the property being edited.
The PropertyEditorSupport class is a trivial
implementation of PropertyEditor, suitable for
subclassing, or for supporting a list of
PropertyChangeListener objects.
