28.24 java.net.URLEncoder (JDK 1.0)
This class defines a single static method which is used to
convert a string to its URL-encoded form. That is, spaces
are converted to "+", and non-alphanumeric characters other
than underscore are output as two hexadecimal digits
following a percent sign. Note that this technique only
works for 8-bit characters. This method is used to
"canonicalize" a URL specification so that it uses only
characters from an extremely portable subset of ASCII which
can be correctly handled by computers around the world.
