ImageObserver
Name
ImageObserver
Description
ImageObserver is an interface 
that provides constants and the callback mechanism to receive asynchronous 
information about the status of an image as it loads. 
Interface Definition
public abstract interface java.awt.image.ImageObserver {
  // Constants
  public static final int ABORT;
  public static final int ALLBITS;
  public static final int ERROR;
  public static final int FRAMEBITS;
  public static final int HEIGHT;
  public static final int PROPERTIES;
  public static final int SOMEBITS;
  public static final int WIDTH;
  // Interface Methods
  public abstract boolean imageUpdate (Image image, int infoflags, 
     int x, int y, int width, int height);
}
Constants
ABORT
public static final int ABORT
The ABORT flag indicates that 
the image aborted during loading. An attempt to reload the image may succeed, 
unless ERROR is also set. 
ALLBITS
public static final int ALLBITS
The ALLBITS flag indicates 
that the image has completely loaded successfully. The x, 
y, width, 
and height arguments to imageUpdate() 
should be ignored. 
ERROR
public static final int ERROR
The ERROR flag indicates that 
an error happened during the image loading process. An attempt to reload 
the image will fail. 
FRAMEBITS
public static final int FRAMEBITS
The FRAMEBITS flag indicates 
that a complete frame of a multi-frame image has loaded. The x, 
y, width, 
and height arguments to imageUpdate() 
should be ignored. 
HEIGHT
public static final int HEIGHT
The HEIGHT flag indicates that 
the height information is available for an image; the image's height 
is in the height argument to 
imageUpdate(). 
PROPERTIES
public static final int PROPERTIES
The PROPERTIES flag indicates 
that the properties information is available for an image. 
SOMEBITS
public static final int SOMEBITS
The SOMEBITS flag indicates 
that the image has started loading and some pixels are available. The bounding 
rectangle for the pixels that have been delivered so far is indicated by 
the x, y, 
width, and height 
arguments to imageUpdate(). 
WIDTH
public static final int WIDTH
The WIDTH flag indicates that 
the width information is available for an image; the image's width 
is in the width argument to 
imageUpdate(). 
Interface Methods
imageUpdate
public abstract boolean imageUpdate (Image image, int infoflags, int x, int y, int width, int height)
Parameters
image
Image that is being loaded.
infoflags
The ImageObserver 
flags for the information that is currently available.
x
Meaning depends on infoflags 
that are set.
y
Meaning depends on infoflags 
that are set.
width
Meaning depends on infoflags 
that are set.
height
Meaning depends on infoflags 
that are set. 
Returns
true if image has completed 
loading (successfully or unsuccessfully), false 
if additional information needs to be loaded. 
Description
Provides the callback mechanism for the asynchronous loading of images.
