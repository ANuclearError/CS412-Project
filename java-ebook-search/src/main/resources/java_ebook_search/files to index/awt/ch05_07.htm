5.7 Cursor
Introduced in Java 1.1, the Cursor 
class provides the different cursors that can be associated with a Component. 
Previously, cursors could only be associated with a whole Frame. 
Now any component can use fancy cursors when the user is interacting with 
the system. 
To change the cursor, a component calls its setCursor() 
method; its argument is a Cursor 
object, which is defined by this class. 
NOTE: 
There is still no way to assign a user-defined cursor to a Component. 
You are restricted to the 14 predefined cursors. 
Cursor Constants
The following is a list of Cursor constants. 
The cursors corresponding to the constants are shown in Figure 5.6.
public final static int DEFAULT_CURSOR
public final static int CROSSHAIR_CURSOR
public final static int TEXT_CURSOR 
public final static int WAIT_CURSOR 
public final static int HAND_CURSOR
public final static int MOVE_CURSOR
public final static int N_RESIZE_CURSOR 
public final static int S_RESIZE_CURSOR 
public final static int E_RESIZE_CURSOR
public final static int W_RESIZE_CURSOR 
public final static int NE_RESIZE_CURSOR 
public final static int NW_RESIZE_CURSOR 
public final static int SE_RESIZE_CURSOR 
public final static int SW_RESIZE_CURSOR

Cursor Methods
public Cursor (int type)   
The sole constructor creates a Cursor 
of the specified type. type 
must be one of the Cursor class 
constants. If type is not one 
of the class constants, the constructor throws the run-time exception IllegalArgumentException. 
This constructor exists primarily to support object serialization; you 
don't need to call it in your code. It is more efficient to call 
getPredefinedCursor(), 
discussed later in this section. 
Miscellaneous methods
public int getType()  
The getType() method returns 
the cursor type. The value returned is one of the class constants. 
static public Cursor getPredefinedCursor(int type)  
The getPredefinedCursor() method 
returns the predefined Cursor 
of the given type. If type 
is not one of the class constants, this method throws the run-time exception 
IllegalArgumentException. This 
method checks what Cursor objects 
already exist and gives you a reference to a preexisting Cursor 
if it can find one with the appropriate type. Otherwise, it creates a new 
Cursor for you. This is more 
efficient than calling the Cursor 
constructor whenever you need one. 
static public Cursor getDefaultCursor()  
The getDefaultCursor() method 
returns the predefined Cursor 
for the DEFAULT_CURSOR type.
