12.2 ColorModel
A color model determines how colors are represented within AWT. ColorModel 
is an abstract class that you can subclass to specify your own representation 
for colors. AWT provides two concrete subclasses of ColorModel 
that you can use to build your own color model; they are DirectColorModel 
and IndexColorModel. These 
two correspond to the two ways computers represent colors internally. 
Most modern computer systems use 24 bits to represent each pixel. These 
24 bits contain 8 bits for each primary color (red, green, blue); each 
set of 8 bits represents the intensity of that color for the particular pixel. 
This arrangement yields the familiar "16 million colors" that 
you see in advertisements. It corresponds closely to Java's direct 
color model. 
However, 24 bits per pixel, with something like a million pixels on the 
screen, adds up to a lot of memory. In the dark ages, memory was expensive, 
and devoting this much memory to a screen buffer cost too much. Therefore, 
designers used fewer bits--possibly as few as three, but more often 
eight--for each pixel. Instead of representing the colors directly 
in these bits, the bits were an index into a color map. Graphics programs 
would load the color map with the colors they were interested in and then 
represent each pixel by using the index of the appropriate color in the 
map. For example, the value 1 might represent fuschia; the value 2 might represent 
puce. Full information about how to display each color (the red, green, 
and blue components that make up fuschia or puce) is contained only in 
the color map. This arrangement corresponds closely to Java's indexed 
color model. 
Because Java is platform-independent, you don't need to worry about 
how your computer or the user's computer represents colors. Your 
programs can use an indexed or direct color map as appropriate. Java will 
do the best it can to render the colors you request. Of course, if you 
use 5,000 colors on a computer that can only display 256, Java is going 
to have to make compromises. It will decide which colors to put in the color 
map and which colors are close enough to the colors in the color map, 
but that's done behind your back. 
Java's default color model uses 8 bits per pixel for red, green, 
and blue, along with another 8 bits for alpha (transparency) level. However, 
as I said earlier, you can create your own ColorModel 
if you want to work in some other scheme. For example, you could create 
a grayscale color model for black and white pictures, or an HSB (hue, 
saturation, brightness) color model if you are more comfortable working 
with this system. Your color model's job will be to take a pixel 
value in your representation and translate that value into the corresponding 
alpha, red, green, and blue values. If you are working with a grayscale 
image, your image producer could deliver grayscale values to the image 
consumer, plus a ColorModel 
that tells the consumer how to render these gray values in terms of ARGB 
components. 
ColorModel MethodsConstructors
public ColorModel (int bits) 
There is a single constructor for ColorModel. 
It has one parameter, bits, 
which describes the number of bits required per pixel of an image. Since 
this is an abstract class, you cannot call this constructor directly. Since 
each pixel value must be stored within an integer, the maximum value for 
bits is 32. If you request more, you get 32. 
Pseudo-constructors
public static ColorModel getRGBdefault() 
The getRGBdefault() method 
returns the default ColorModel, 
which has 8 bits for each of the components alpha, red, green, and blue. 
The order the pixels are stored in an integer is 0xAARRGGBB, or alpha in 
highest order byte, down to blue in the lowest. 
Other methods
public int getPixelSize () 
The getPixelSize() method returns 
the number of bits required for each pixel as described by this color model. 
That is, it returns the number of bits passed to the constructor. 
public abstract int getAlpha (int pixel)
The getAlpha() method returns 
the alpha component of pixel 
for a color model. Its range must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel is completely transparent and the background will 
appear through the pixel. A value of 255 means the pixel is opaque and 
you cannot see the background behind it. 
public abstract int getRed (int pixel)
The getRed() method returns 
the red component of pixel 
for a color model. Its range must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel has no red in it. A value of 255 means red is at maximum 
intensity. 
public abstract int getGreen (int pixel)
The getGreen() method returns 
the green component of pixel 
for a color model. Its range must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel has no green in it. A value of 255 means green is 
at maximum intensity. 
public abstract int getBlue (int pixel)
The getBlue() method returns 
the blue component of pixel 
for a color model. Its range must be between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel has no blue in it. A value of 255 means blue is at 
maximum intensity. 
public int getRGB(int pixel)
The getRGB() method returns 
the color of pixel in the default 
RGB color model. If a subclass has changed the ordering or size of the 
different color components, getRGB() 
will return the pixel in the RGB color model (0xAARRGGBB order). In theory, 
the subclass does not need to override this method, unless it wants to 
make it final. Making this method final may yield a significant performance 
improvement. 
public void finalize ()  
The garbage collector calls finalize() 
when it determines that the ColorModel 
object is no longer needed. finalize() frees 
any internal resources that the ColorModel 
object has used. 
DirectColorModel
The DirectColorModel class 
is a concrete subclass of ColorModel. 
It specifies a color model in which each pixel contains all the color information 
(alpha, red, green, and blue values) explicitly. Pixels are represented 
by 32-bit (int) quantities; the constructor lets you change which bits 
are allotted to each component. 
All of the methods in this class, except constructors, are final, because 
of assumptions made by the implementation. You can create subclasses of 
DirectColorModel, but you 
can't override any of its methods. However, you should not need to 
develop your own subclass. Just create an instance of DirectColorModel 
with the appropriate constructor. Any subclassing results in serious performance 
degradation, because you are going from fast, static final method calls to 
dynamic method lookups.Constructors
public DirectColorModel (int bits, int redMask, int greenMask, int blueMask, 
int alphaMask) 
This constructor creates a DirectColorModel 
in which bits represents the total number of bits used to represent a pixel; 
it must be less than or equal to 32. The redMask, 
greenMask, blueMask, 
and alphaMask specify where 
in a pixel each color component exists. Each of the bit masks must be contiguous 
(e.g., red cannot be the first, fourth, and seventh bits of the pixel), 
must be smaller than 2^bits, 
and should not exceed 8 bits. (You cannot display more than 8 bits of data 
for any color component, but the mask can be larger.) Combined, the masks 
together should be bits in 
length. The default RGB color model is: 
new DirectColorModel (32, 0x00ff0000, 0x0000ff00, 0x000000ff, 0xff000000)
The run-time exception IllegalArgumentException is 
thrown if any of the following occur: 
The bits that are set in a mask are not contiguous.
Mask bits overlap (i.e., the same bit is set in two or more masks).
The number of mask bits exceeds bits.
public DirectColorModel (int bits, int redMask, int greenMask, int blueMask) 
This constructor for DirectColorModel 
calls the first with an alpha mask of 0, which means that colors in this 
color model have no transparency component. All colors will be fully opaque 
with an alpha value of 255. The same restrictions for the red, green, and 
blue masks apply. 
Methods
final public int getAlpha (int pixel) 
The getAlpha() method returns 
the alpha component of pixel 
for the color model as a number from 0 to 255, inclusive. A value of 0 
means the pixel is completely transparent, and the background will appear 
through the pixel. A value of 255 means the pixel is opaque, and you cannot 
see the background behind it. 
final public int getRed (int pixel) 
The getRed() method returns 
the red component of pixel 
for the color model. Its range is from 0 to 255. A value of 0 means the 
pixel has no red in it. A value of 255 means red is at maximum intensity. 
final public int getGreen (int pixel) 
The getGreen() method returns 
the green component of pixel 
for the color model. Its range is from 0 to 255. A value of 0 means the 
pixel has no green in it. A value of 255 means green is at maximum intensity. 
final public int getBlue (int pixel) 
The getBlue() method returns 
the blue component of pixel 
for the color model. Its range is from 0 to 255. A value of 0 means the 
pixel has no blue in it. A value of 255 means blue is at maximum intensity. 
final public int getRGB (int pixel) 
The getRGB() method returns 
the color of pixel in the default 
RGB color model. If a subclass has changed the ordering or size of the 
different color components, getRGB() 
will return the pixel in the RGB color model (0xAARRGGBB order). The getRGB() 
method in this subclass is identical to the method in ColorModel 
but overrides it to make it final. 
Other methods
final public int getAlphaMask () 
The getAlphaMask() method returns 
the alphaMask from the DirectColorModel 
constructor (or 0 if constructor did not have alphaMask). 
The alphaMask specifies which 
bits in the pixel represent the alpha transparency component of the color 
model. 
final public int getRedMask () 
The getRedMask() method returns 
the redMask from the DirectColorModel 
constructor. The redMask specifies 
which bits in the pixel represent the red component of the color model. 
final public int getGreenMask () 
The getGreenMask() method returns 
the greenMask from the DirectColorModel 
constructor. The greenMask 
specifies which bits in the pixel represent the green component of the 
color model. 
final public int getBlueMask () 
The getBlueMask() method returns 
the blueMask from the DirectColorModel 
constructor. The blueMask specifies 
which bits in the pixel represent the blue component of the color model. 
IndexColorModel
The IndexColorModel is another 
concrete subclass of ColorModel. 
It specifies a ColorModel that 
uses a color map lookup table (with a maximum size of 256), rather than 
storing color information in the pixels themselves. Pixels are represented 
by an index into the color map, which is at most an 8-bit quantity. Each 
entry in the color map gives the alpha, red, green, and blue components 
of some color. One entry in the map can be designated "transparent." 
This is called the "transparent pixel"; the alpha component 
of this map entry is ignored. 
All of the methods in this class, except constructors, are final because 
of assumptions made by the implementation. You shouldn't need to 
create subclasses; you can if necessary, but you can't override any 
of the IndexColorModel methods. 
Example 12.2 (later in this chapter) uses an IndexColorModel. Constructors
There are two sets of constructors for IndexColorModel. 
The first two constructors use a single-byte array for the color map. The 
second group implements the color map with separate byte arrays for each 
color component. 
public IndexColorModel (int bits, int size, byte colorMap[], int start, 
boolean hasalpha, int transparent) 
This constructor creates an IndexColorModel. 
bits is the number of bits 
used to represent each pixel and must not exceed 8. size 
is the number of elements in the map; it must be less than 2^bits. hasalpha 
should be true if the color map includes alpha (transparency) components 
and false if it doesn't. transparent 
is the location of the transparent pixel in the map (i.e., the pixel value 
that is considered transparent). If there is no transparent pixel, set 
transparent to -1. 
The colorMap describes the 
colors used to paint pixels. start 
is the index within the colorMap 
array at which the map begins; prior elements of the array are ignored. 
An entry in the map consists of three or four consecutive bytes, representing 
the red, green, blue, and (optionally) alpha components. If hasalpha 
is false, a map entry consists of three bytes, and no alpha components are 
present; if hasalpha is true, 
map entries consist of four bytes, and all four components must be present. 
For example, consider a pixel whose value is p, and a color map with a 
hasalpha set to false. Therefore, 
each element in the color map occupies three consecutive array elements. 
The red component of that pixel will be located at colorMap[start 
+ 3*p]; the green component will be at colorMap[start 
+ 3*p + 1]; and so on. The value of size may 
be smaller than 2^bits, 
meaning that there may be pixel values with no corresponding entry in the 
color map. These pixel values (i.e., size  &lt; 2^bits) are painted with the color components 
set to 0; they are transparent if hasalpha 
is true, opaque otherwise. 
If bits is too large (greater 
than 8), size is too large 
(greater than 2^bits), 
or the colorMap array is too 
small to hold the map, the run-time 
exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
will be thrown. 
public IndexColorModel (int bits, int size, byte colorMap[], int start, 
boolean hasalpha) 
This version of the IndexColorModel 
constructor calls the previous constructor with a transparent 
index of -1; that is, there is no transparent pixel. If bits 
is too large (greater than 8), or size 
is too large (greater than 2^bits), 
or the colorMap array is too 
small to hold the map, the run-time 
exception, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
will be thrown. 
public IndexColorModel (int bits, int size, byte red[], byte green[], byte 
blue[],  int transparent) 
The second set of constructors for IndexColorModel 
is similar to the first group, with the exception that these constructors 
use three or four separate arrays (one per color component) to represent 
the color map, instead of a single array. 
The bits parameter still represents 
the number of bits in a pixel. size 
represents the number of elements in the color map. transparent 
is the location of the transparent pixel in the map (i.e., the pixel value 
that is considered transparent). If there is no transparent pixel, set 
transparent to -1. 
The red, green, 
and blue arrays contain the 
color map itself. These arrays must have at least size 
elements. They contain the red, green, and blue components of the colors 
in the map. For example, if a pixel is at position p, 
red[p] contains the pixel's 
red component; green[p] contains 
the green component; and blue[p] 
contains the blue component. The value of size 
may be smaller than 2^bits, 
meaning that there may be pixel values with no corresponding entry in the 
color map. These pixel values (i.e., size  2^bits) 
are painted with the color components set to 0. 
If bits is too large (greater 
than 8), size is too large 
(greater than 2^bits), 
or the red, green, and blue arrays are too small to hold the map, the run-time exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
will be thrown. 
public IndexColorModel (int bits, int size, byte red[], byte green[], byte 
blue[]) 
This version of the IndexColorModel 
constructor calls the previous one with a transparent 
index of -1; that is, there is no transparent pixel. If bits 
is too large (greater than 8), size 
is too large (greater than 2^bits), 
or the red, green, and blue arrays are too small to hold the map, the run-time exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
will be thrown. 
public IndexColorModel (int bits, int size, byte red[], byte green[], byte 
blue[], byte alpha[]) 
Like the previous constructor, this version creates an IndexColorModel 
with no transparent pixel. It differs from the previous constructor in 
that it supports transparency; the array alpha contains the map's 
transparency values. If bits 
is too large (greater than 8), size 
is too large (greater than 2^bits), 
or the red, green, blue, and alpha arrays are too small to hold the map, 
the run-time exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
will be thrown. 
Methods
final public int getAlpha (int pixel) 
The getAlpha() method returns 
the alpha component of pixel 
for a color model, which is a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel is completely transparent and the background will 
appear through the pixel. A value of 255 means the pixel is opaque and 
you cannot see the background behind it. 
final public int getRed (int pixel) 
The getRed() method returns 
the red component of pixel 
for a color model, which is a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel has no red in it. A value of 255 means red is at maximum 
intensity. 
final public int getGreen (int pixel) 
The getGreen() method returns 
the green component of pixel 
for a color model, which is a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel has no green in it. A value of 255 means green is 
at maximum intensity. 
final public int getBlue (int pixel) 
The getBlue() method returns 
the blue component of pixel 
for a color model, which is a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. A value 
of 0 means the pixel has no blue in it. A value of 255 means blue is at 
maximum intensity. 
final public int getRGB (int pixel) 
The getRGB() method returns 
the color of pixel in the default 
RGB color model. If a subclass has changed the ordering or size of the 
different color components, getRGB() 
will return the pixel in the RGB color model (0xAARRGGBB order). This version 
of getRGB is identical to the version in the ColorModel 
class but overrides it to make it final. 
Other methods
final public int getMapSize() 
The getMapSize() method returns 
the size of the color map (i.e., the number of distinct colors). 
final public int getTransparentPixel () 
The getTransparentPixel() method 
returns the color map index for the transparent pixel in the color model. 
If no transparent pixel exists, it returns -1. It is not possible to change 
the transparent pixel after the color model has been created. 
final public void getAlphas (byte alphas[]) 
The getAlphas() method copies 
the alpha components of the ColorModel 
into elements 0 through getMapSize()-1 
of the alphas array. Space 
must already be allocated in the alphas 
array. 
final public void getReds (byte reds[]) 
The getReds() method copies 
the red components of the ColorModel 
into elements 0 through getMapSize()-1 
of the reds array. Space must 
already be allocated in the reds 
array. 
final public void getGreens (byte greens[]) 
The getGreens() method copies 
the green components of the ColorModel 
into elements 0 through getMapSize()-1 
of the greens array. Space 
must already be allocated in the greens 
array. 
final public void getBlues (byte blues[]) 
The getBlues() method copies 
the blue components of the ColorModel 
into elements 0 through getMapSize()-1 
of the blues array. Space must 
already be allocated in the blues 
array.
