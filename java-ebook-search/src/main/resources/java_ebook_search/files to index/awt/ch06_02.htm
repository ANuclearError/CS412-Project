6.2 Panel
The Panel class provides a 
generic container within an existing display area. It is the simplest of 
all the containers. When you load an applet into Netscape Navigator or 
an appletviewer, you have a Panel 
to work with at the highest level. 
A Panel has no physical appearance. 
It is just a rectangular display area. The default LayoutManager 
of Panel is FlowLayout; 
FlowLayout is described in 
FlowLayout. 
Panel MethodsConstructors
public Panel () 
The first constructor creates a Panel 
with a LayoutManager of FlowLayout. 
public Panel (LayoutManager layout)  
This constructor allows you to set the initial LayoutManager 
of the new Panel to layout. 
If layout is null, 
there is no LayoutManager, and 
you must shape and position the components within the Panel 
yourself. 
Miscellaneous methods
public void addNotify ()  
The addNotify() method creates 
the Panel peer. If 
you override this method, first call super.addNotify(), 
then add your customizations for the new class. Then you can do everything 
you need with the information about the newly created peer. 
Panel Events
In Java 1.0, a Panel 
peer generates all the events that are generated by the Component 
class; it does not generate events that are specific to a particular type 
of component. That is, it generates key events, mouse events, and focus 
events; it doesn't generate action events or list events. If an event 
happens within a child component of a Panel, 
the target of the event is the child component, not the Panel. 
There's one exception to this rule: if a component uses the LightweightPeer 
(new to Java 1.1), it cannot be the target of an event. 
With Java 1.1, events are delivered to whatever listener is associated 
with a contained component. The fact that the component is within a Panel 
has no relevance.
