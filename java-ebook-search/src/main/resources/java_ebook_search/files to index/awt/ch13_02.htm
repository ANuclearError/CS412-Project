Chapter 13AWT Exceptions and Errors
13.2 IllegalComponentStateException
IllegalComponentStateException 
is a subclass of IllegalStateException; 
both are new to Java 1.1. This exception is used when you try to do something 
with a Component that is not 
yet appropriate. With the standard AWT components, this can happen only 
in three instances:
If you call setCaretPosition() 
to set the cursor position of a text component before the component's 
peer exists.
If you call getLocale() 
to get the locale of a component that does not have one and is not in 
a container that has one.
If you call getLocationOnScreen() 
for a component that is not showing.
In these cases, the operation isn't 
fundamentally illegal; you are just trying to perform it before the component 
is ready. When you create your own components, you should consider using 
this exception for similar cases. 
Since IllegalComponentStateException 
is a subclass of Run-TimeException, 
you do not have to enclose method calls that might throw this exception 
within try/catch blocks. However, catching this exception isn't a bad idea, since it should be fairly easy to correct the problem and retry the operation.
IllegalComponentStateException MethodConstructor
public IllegalComponentStateException ()  
The first constructor creates an IllegalComponentStateException 
instance with no detail message. 
public IllegalComponentStateException (String message)   
This constructor creates an IllegalComponentStateException 
with a detail message of message. 
This message can be retrieved using getMessage(), 
which it inherits from Exception 
(and is required by the Throwable 
interface). 
IllegalComponentStateException Example
The following code throws an IllegalComponentStateException. 
The Exception occurs because 
the TextField peer does not 
exist when setCaretPosition() 
is called. setCaretPosition() 
throws an IllegalComponentStateException, 
and the next statement never executes. 
import java.awt.TextField;
public class illegal {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        new TextField().setCaretPosition (24);
        System.out.println ("Never gets here");
    }
}
