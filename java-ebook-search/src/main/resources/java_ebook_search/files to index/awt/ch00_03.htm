About the Source Code
The source code for the programs presented in this book is available online. 
See http://www.ora.com/catalog/javawt/ 
for downloading instructions. 
Obtaining the Example Programs
The example programs in this book are available electronically
in a number of ways: by FTP, Ftpmail,
BITFTP, and UUCP. The
cheapest, fastest, and easiest ways are listed first. If
you read from the top down, the first one that works for you is
probably the best. Use FTP if you are directly on the
Internet. Use Ftpmail if you are not on the Internet but can send
and receive electronic mail to Internet sites (this includes
CompuServe users). Use BITFTP if you send electronic mail via BITNET.
Use UUCP if none of the above works.
FTP
 
To use FTP, you need a machine with direct access to the
Internet. A sample session is shown, with what you should type in
boldface.
% ftp ftp.ora.com
Connected to ftp.ora.com.
220 FTP server (Version 6.21 Tue Mar 10 22:09:55 EST 1992) ready.
Name (ftp.ora.com:yourname): anonymous
331 Guest login ok, send domain style e-mail address as password.
Password: yourname@yourhost.com (use your user name and host here)
230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
ftp&gt; cd /published/oreilly/java/awt
250 CWD command successful.
ftp&gt; binary (Very important! You must specify binary transfer for compressed files.)
200 Type set to I.
ftp&gt; get examples.tar.gz
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for examples.tar.gz.
226 Transfer complete.
ftp&gt; quit
221 Goodbye.
%
The file is a compressed tar archive; extract the files
from the archive by typing:
% zcat examples.tar.gz | tar xvf -
System V systems require the following tar command instead:
% zcat examples.tar.gz | tar xof -
If zcat is not available on your system, use separate
gunzip and tar commands.
% gunzip examples.tar.gz
% tar xvf examples.tar
Ftpmail
 
Ftpmail is a mail server available to anyone who can
send electronic
mail to, and receive it from, Internet sites. This includes any company
or service provider that allows email connections to the Internet. Here's
how you do it.
You send mail to ftpmail@online.ora.com. (Be sure
to address the message to ftpmail and not to
ftp.) In the message body,
give the FTP commands you want to run. The server will run anonymous
FTP for you and mail the files back to you. To get a complete help file,
send a message with no subject and the single word "help" in the
body.
The following is a sample mail session that should get you the examples.
This command sends you a listing of the files in the selected directory
and the requested example files. The listing is useful if there's a later
version of the examples you're interested in.
% mail ftpmail@online.ora.com
Subject:
reply-to yourname@yourhost.com    Where you want files mailed
open
cd /published/oreilly/java/awt
dir
mode binary
uuencode
get examples.tar.gz
quit
.
A signature at the end of the message is acceptable as long as it
appears after "quit."
BITFTP
 
BITFTP is a mail server for BITNET users. You send it
electronic mail messages requesting files, and it sends you back
the files by electronic mail. BITFTP currently serves only
users who send it mail from nodes that are directly on
BITNET, EARN, or NetNorth. BITFTP is a public service
of Princeton
University. Here's how it works.
To use BITFTP, send mail containing your FTP commands to
BITFTP@PUCC. For a complete help
file, send HELP as the message body.
The following is the message body you send to BITFTP:
FTP  ftp.uu.net  NETDATA
USER  anonymous
PASS  yourname@yourhost.edu Put your Internet email address here (not your BITNET address)
CD  /published/oreilly/java/awt
DIR
BINARY
GET  examples.tar.gz
QUIT
Once you've got the desired file, follow the directions under FTP
to extract the files from the archive. Since you are probably not
on a UNIX system, you may need to get versions of uudecode,
uncompress, atob, and tar for your system.
VMS, DOS, and Mac versions are available. The VMS versions
are on gatekeeper.dec.com in /pub/VMS.
UUCP
 
UUCP is standard on virtually all UNIX
systems and is available for
IBM-compatible PCs and Apple Macintoshes.
The examples are available by UUCP via modem from UUNET; UUNET's
connect-time charges apply.
If you or your company has an account with
UUNET, you have a system somewhere
with a direct UUCP connection to
UUNET. Find that system, and type:
uucp uunet\!~/published/oreilly/java/awt/examples.tar.gz yourhost\!~/yourname/
The backslashes can be omitted if you use the Bourne shell (sh)
instead of csh. The file should appear some time later (up to a
day or more) in the directory
/usr/spool/uucppublic/yourname.
If you don't have an account, but would like one so that you can
get electronic mail, contact UUNET at 703-204-8000.
Once you've got the desired file, follow the directions under FTP
to extract the files from the archive.
