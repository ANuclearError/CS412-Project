Event
Name
Event
Description
The Event class represents 
events that happen within the Java environment in a platform independent 
way. Events typically represent user actions, like typing a key or clicking 
the mouse. Although this class has been updated for the 1.1 release, it 
is only used for the 1.0 event model. When using the 1.1 event model, all 
events are represented by subclasses of java.awt.AWTEvent.
