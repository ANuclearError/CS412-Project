14.4 AppletStub Interface
The AppletStub interface provides 
a way to get information from the run-time browser environment. The Applet 
class provides methods with similar names that call these methods. Methods
public abstract boolean isActive () 
The isActive() method returns 
the current state of the applet. While an applet is initializing, it is 
not active, and calls to isActive() 
return false. The system marks the applet active just prior to calling 
start(); after this point, 
calls to isActive() return 
true. 
public abstract URL getDocumentBase () 
The getDocumentBase() method 
returns the complete URL of the HTML 
file that loaded the applet. This method can be used with the getImage() 
or getAudioClip() methods to 
load an image or audio file relative to the HTML file. 
public abstract URL getCodeBase () 
The getCodeBase() method returns 
the complete URL of the .class 
file that contains the applet. This method can be used with the getImage() method 
or the getAudioClip() method to 
load an image or audio file relative to the .class 
file. 
public abstract String getParameter (String name) 
The getParameter() method allows 
you to get parameters from &lt;PARAM&gt; 
tags within the &lt;APPLET&gt; 
tag of the HTML file that loaded the applet. The name 
parameter of getParameter() 
must match the name string of the &lt;PARAM&gt; 
tag; name is case insensitive. 
The return value of getParameter() 
is the value associated with name; 
it is always a String regardless 
of the type of data in the tag. If name 
is not found within the &lt;PARAM&gt; 
tags of the &lt;APPLET&gt;, 
getParameter() returns null. 
public abstract AppletContext getAppletContext () 
The getAppletContext() method 
returns the current AppletContext 
of the applet. This is part of the stub that is set by the system when 
setStub() is called. 
public abstract void appletResize (int width, int height) 
The appletResize() method is 
called by the resize method of the Applet class. The method changes the 
size of the applet space to width 
x height. The browser must 
support changing the applet space; if it doesn't, the size remains 
unchanged.
