Variables
anchor
public int anchor
Specifies the alignment of the component in the event that it is smaller 
than the space allotted for it by the layout manager; e.g., CENTER 
centers the object within the region. 
fill
public int fill
The component's resize policy if additional space available. 
gridheight
public int gridheight
Number of columns a component occupies. 
gridwidth
public int gridwidth
Number of rows a component occupies. 
gridx
public int gridx
Horizontal grid position at which to add component. 
gridy
public int gridy
Vertical grid position at which to add component. 
insets
public Insets insets
Specifies the outer padding around the component. 
ipadx
public int ipadx
Serves as the internal padding within the component in both the right and 
left directions. 
ipady
public int ipady
Serves as the internal padding within the component in both the top and 
bottom directions. 
weightx
public double weightx
Represents the percentage of extra horizontal space that will be given 
to this component if there is additional space available within the container. 
weighty
public double weighty
Represents the percentage of extra vertical space that will be given to 
this component if there is additional space available within the container.
