WindowAdapter 
Name
WindowAdapter 
Description
The WindowAdapter class implements the methods of WindowListener 
with empty functions. It may be easier for you to extend WindowAdapter, 
overriding only those methods you are interested in, than to implement 
WindowListener and provide 
the empty functions yourself.
