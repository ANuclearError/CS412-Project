Preface
About Java
Java is one of 13,000 islands that makes up Indonesia, whose capital is 
Jakarta (see Figure 0.1). It is home to about 120 million people with an area about 50,000 
square miles. While on the island, you can hear traditional music such 
as gamelan or angklung. The island also has a dangerous volcano named Merapi, 
which makes up part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire." In 1891, fossils 
from Pithecanthropus erectus, better known as "Java man" (homo 
javanensis) were discovered on the island by Eugene Dubois.

Java's main export is a coffee that is considered spicy and full bodied, with 
a strong, slightly acidic flavor. O'Reilly has shown good taste in 
staying away from the pervasive coffee theme in its book titles and cover 
designs. (However, if you're ever in Sebastopol, check out the coffee 
at AromaRoasters in Santa Rosa.)
