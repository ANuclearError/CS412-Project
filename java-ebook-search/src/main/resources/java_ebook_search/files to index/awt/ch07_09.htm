7.9 Disabling the LayoutManager
To create a container with no layout manager, use null as the argument 
to setLayout(). If you do this, 
you must size and position every component individually. In most cases, 
disabling the LayoutManager 
is a bad idea because what might look great on one platform could look 
really bad on another, due to differences in fonts, native components, 
and other display characteristics. Figure 7.13 displays 
a container with a disabled LayoutManager; 
both buttons were positioned by specifying their size and location explicitly. 
Figure 7.13: Applet with disabled layout manager
Here's the code that produces Figure 7.13:
import java.awt.Button;
import java.applet.Applet;
public class noLayout extends Applet {
    public void init () {
        setLayout (null);
        Button x = new Button ("Hello");
        add (x);
        x.reshape (50, 60, 50, 70);
        Button y = new Button ("World");
        add (y);
        y.reshape (100, 120, 50, 70);
    }
}
