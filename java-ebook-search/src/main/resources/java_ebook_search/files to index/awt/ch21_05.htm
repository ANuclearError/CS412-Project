ComponentAdapter 
Name
ComponentAdapter 
Description
ComponentAdapter is a class 
that implements the methods of ComponentListener 
with empty functions. It may be easier for you to extend ComponentAdapter, 
overriding only those methods you are interested in, than to implement 
ComponentListener and provide 
the empty functions yourself.
