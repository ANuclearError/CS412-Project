Description
The Clipboard class is a repository for a
Transferable object and can be used for cut, copy,
and paste operations. The system clipboard can be accessed by calling
Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard().
You can use this technique if you are interested in exchanging data
between your application and other applications (Java or non-Java)
running on the system. In addition, Clipboard can
be instantiated directly, if "private" clipboards are
needed.
