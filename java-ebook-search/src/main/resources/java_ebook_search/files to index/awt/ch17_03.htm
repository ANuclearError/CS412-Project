17.3 Component Methods
The methods that start the printing process come from either the Component 
or Container class and are 
inherited by all their children. All components inherit the printAll() 
and print() methods. Containers 
also inherit the printComponents() 
method, in addition to printAll() 
and print(). A container should 
call printComponents() to print 
itself if it contains any components. Otherwise, it is sufficient to call 
printAll(). 
These methods end up calling paint(), 
which does the actual drawing.
