A.3 Resource Bundles
Java 1.1 adds two new pieces to make its property lists more general and 
flexible. The first is the ability to use localized resource bundles; the 
second is the use of resource files. 
Resource bundles let you write internationalized programs. The general 
idea is that any string you want to display (for example, a button label) 
shouldn't be specified as a literal constant. Instead, you want to 
look up the string in a table of equivalents--a "resource bundle"--that 
contains equivalent strings for different locales. For example, the string 
"yes" is equivalent to "ja", "si", 
"oui", and many other language-specific alternatives. A resource 
bundle lets your program look up the right alternative at run-time, depending 
on the user's locale. The list of alternatives must be implemented 
as a subclass of ResourceBundle 
or ListResourceBundle, in which 
you provide a key value pair for each label. For each locale you support, 
a separate subclass and list must be provided. Then you look up the 
appropriate string through the ResourceBundle.getString() 
method. A complete example of how to use resource bundles could easily require 
an entire chapter; I hope this is enough information to get you started.[1]

See the Java Fundamental Classes Reference 
for a more complete description.
Resource bundles have one important implication for more mundane programs. 
Resource bundles can be saved in files and read at run-time. To support 
them, Java 1.1 has added the ability to load arbitrary properties files. 
In Example A.1, we looked for the prop.list 
file on the applet server. What if we want to permit users to modify the 
default font to be what they want, not what we think they want? With Java 
1.0, that could not be done because there was no way for an applet to access 
the local filesystem. Now, with Java 1.1, you can access read-only resource 
files located in the CLASSPATH. 
To do so, you use the Class.getResource() 
method, which takes the name of a properties list file as an argument. 
This method returns the URL of the file requested, which could be available 
locally or on the applet server; where it actually looks depends on the 
ClassLoader. Once the file 
is found, treat it as a Properties file, as in Example A.1, or do anything 
you want with it. A similar method, Class.getResourceAsStream(), 
returns the InputStream to 
work with, instead of the URL. 
Example A.2 is similar to Example A.1. 
The file prop11.list 
includes three properties: the font to use, a message, and an image. We 
need only a single property because we can use the new Font.decode() 
method to convert a complete font specification into a Font 
object: we don't need to load the font information in pieces, as 
we did in the earlier example. As an added bonus, this example displays 
an image. The name of the image is given by the property MyProg.image. 
Like the property file itself, the image file can be located anywhere. 
Here's the properties list, which should be placed in the file prop11.list: 
MyProg.font=Helvetica-italic-30
MyProg.message=Hello World
MyProg.image=ora-icon.gif
And the code for the applet is in Example A.2.

            msg = p.getProperty("MyProg.message");
            String name = p.getProperty("MyProg.image");           
            URL url = getClass().getResource(name);
            im = getImage (url);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println ("error loading props...");
        }
    }
