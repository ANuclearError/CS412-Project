9.5 ItemSelectable
In Java 1.1, the classes Checkbox, Choice, 
List, and CheckboxMenuItem 
(covered in the next chapter) share a common interface that defines a method 
for getting the currently selected item or items. This means that you can 
use the same methods to retrieve the selection from any of these classes. 
More important, it means that you can write code that doesn't know 
what kind of selectable item it's working with. For example, you 
could write a method that returns the selectable component from some user 
interface. This method might have the signature: 
public ItemSelectable getChooser();
After you call this method, you can read selections from the user interface 
without knowing exactly what you're dealing with. 
Methods
public Object[] getSelectedObjects ()  
The getSelectedObjects() method 
returns the currently selected item or items as an Object 
array. The return value is null 
if there is nothing selected.
