EventQueue 
Name
EventQueue 
Description
The EventQueue class is a facility for queuing Java 1.1 AWT events, either for the system or for some other purpose. You rarely need to create your own event queue; for most purposes, you will want to work with the system's event queue, which you acquire using the Toolkit.
