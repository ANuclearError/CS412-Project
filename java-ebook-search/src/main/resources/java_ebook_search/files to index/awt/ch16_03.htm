16.3 ClipboardOwner Interface
Classes that need to place objects on a clipboard must implement the ClipboardOwner 
interface. An object becomes the clipboard owner by placing something on 
a Clipboard and remains owner 
as long as that object stays on the clipboard; it loses ownership when 
someone else writes to the clipboard. The ClipboardOwner 
interface provides a way to receive notification when you lose ownership--that 
is, when the object you placed on the clipboard is replaced by something 
else. Methods
public abstract void lostOwnership(Clipboard clipboard, Transferable contents)  
The lostOwnership() method 
tells the owner of contents 
that it is no longer on the given clipboard. 
It is usually implemented as an empty stub but is available for situations in which 
you have to know.
