The Java 1.1 Event Model
This chapter covers Java's event-driven programming model. Unlike 
procedural programs, windows-based programs require an event-driven model 
in which the underlying environment tells your program when something happens. 
For example, when the user clicks on the mouse, the environment generates 
an event that it sends to the program. The program must then figure out 
what the mouse click means and act accordingly. 
This chapter covers two different event models, or ways of handling events. 
In Java 1.0.2 and earlier, events were passed to all components that could 
possibly have an interest in them. Events themselves were encapsulated 
in a single Event class. Java 
1.1 implements a "delegation" model, in which events are 
distributed only to objects that have been registered to receive the event. 
While this is somewhat more complex, it is much more efficient and also 
more flexible, because it allows any object to receive the events generated 
by a component. In turn, this means that you can separate the user interface 
itself from the event-handling code. 
In the Java 1.1 event model, all event functionality is contained in a 
new package, java.awt.event. 
Within this package, subclasses of the abstract class AWTEvent 
represent different kinds of events. The package also includes a number 
of EventListener interfaces 
that are implemented by classes that want to receive different kinds of 
events; they define the methods that are called when events of the appropriate 
type occur. A number of adapter classes are also included; they correspond 
to the EventListener interfaces 
and provide null implementations 
of the methods in the corresponding listener. The adapter classes aren't 
essential but provide a convenient shortcut for developers; rather than 
declaring that your class implements a particular EventListener 
interface, you can declare that your class extends the appropriate adapter. 
The old and new event models are incompatible. Although Java 1.1 supports 
both, you should not use both models in the same program. 
4.1 Java 1.0 Event Model
The event model used in versions 1.0 through 1.0.2 of Java is fairly simple. 
Upon receiving a user-initiated event, like a mouse click, the system generates 
an instance of the Event class 
and passes it along to the program. The program identifies the event's 
target (i.e., the component in which the event occurred) and asks that 
component to handle the event. If the target can't handle this event, 
an attempt is made to find a component that can, and the process repeats. 
That is all there is to it. Most of the work takes place behind the scenes; 
you don't have to worry about identifying potential targets or delivering 
events, except in a few special circumstances. Most Java programs only 
need to provide methods that deal with the specific events they care about. 
Identifying the Target
All events occur within a Java Component. 
The program decides which component gets the event by starting at the outermost 
level and working in. In Figure 4.1, assume that 
the user clicks at the location (156, 70) within the enclosing Frame's 
coordinate space. This action results in a call to the Frame's 
deliverEvent() method, which 
determines which component within the frame should receive the event and 
calls that component's deliverEvent() 
method. In this case, the process continues until it reaches the Button 
labeled Blood, which occupies 
the rectangular space from (135, 60) to (181, 80). Blood doesn't 
contain any internal components, so it must be the component for which 
the event is intended. Therefore, an action event is delivered to Blood, 
with its coordinates translated to fit within the button's coordinate 
space--that is, the button receives an action event with the coordinates 
(21, 10). If the user clicked at the location (47, 96) within the Frame's 
coordinate space, the Frame 
itself would be the target of the event because there is no other component 
at this location. 
Figure 4.1: deliverEvent
To reach Blood, 
the event follows the component/container hierarchy shown 
in Figure 4.2.

Dealing With Events
Once deliverEvent() identifies 
a target, it calls that target's handleEvent() 
method (in this case, the handleEvent() 
method of Blood) to deliver 
the event for processing. If Blood 
has not overridden handleEvent(), 
its default implementation would call Blood's 
action() method. If Blood 
has not overridden action(), 
its default implementation (which is inherited from Component) 
is executed and does nothing. For your program to respond to the event, 
you would have to provide your own implementation of action() 
or handleEvent(). 
handleEvent() plays a particularly 
important role in the overall scheme. It is really a dispatcher, which 
looks at the type of event and calls an appropriate method to do the actual 
work: action() for action events, 
mouseUp() for mouse up events, 
and so on. Table 4.1 shows the event-handler methods 
you would have to override when using the default handleEvent() 
implementation. If you create your own handleEvent(), 
either to handle an event without a default handler or to process events 
differently, it is best to leave these naming conventions in place. Whenever 
you override an event-handler method, it is a good idea to call the overridden 
method to ensure that you don't lose any functionality. All of the 
event handler methods return a boolean, which determines whether there is any further event processing; this is described in the next section, 
"Passing the Buck."

Passing the Buck
In actuality, deliverEvent() 
does not call handleEvent() 
directly. It calls the postEvent() 
method of the target component. In turn, postEvent() 
manages the calls to handleEvent(). postEvent() provides this additional 
level of indirection to monitor the return value of handleEvent(). 
If the event handler returns true, 
the handler has dealt with the event completely. All processing has been 
completed, and the system can move on to the next event. If the event handler 
returns false, the handler 
has not completely processed the event, and postEvent() 
will contact the component's Container 
to finish processing the event. Using the screen in Figure 4.1 
as the basis, Example 4.1 traces the calls through 
deliverEvent(), postEvent(), 
and handleEvent(). The action 
starts when the user clicks on the Blood 
button at coordinates (156, 70). In short, Java dives into the depths of 
the screen's component hierarchy to find the target of the event 
(by way of the method deliverEvent()). 
Once it locates the target, it tries to find something to deal with the 
event by working its way back out (by way of postEvent(), 
handleEvent(), and the convenience 
methods). As you can see, there's a lot of overhead, even in this 
relatively simple example. When we discuss the Java 1.1 event model, 
you will see that it has much less overhead, primarily because it doesn't 
need to go looking for a component to process each event.

                return true
            return true
        return true
    return true
Overriding handleEvent()
In many programs, you only need to override convenience methods like action() 
and mouseUp(); you usually 
don't need to override handleEvent(), 
which is the high level event handler that calls the convenience methods. 
However, convenience methods don't exist for all event types. To 
act upon an event that doesn't have a convenience method (for example, 
LIST_SELECT), you need to override 
handleEvent() itself. Unfortunately, 
this presents a problem. Unlike the convenience methods, for which the 
default versions don't take any action, handleEvent() 
does quite a lot: as we've seen, it's the dispatcher that calls 
the convenience methods. Therefore, when you override handleEvent(), 
either you should reimplement all the features of the method you are overriding 
(a very bad idea), or you must make sure that the original handleEvent()is 
still executed to ensure that the remaining events get handled properly. 
The simplest way for you to do this is for your new handleEvent() 
method to act on any events that it is interested in and return true 
if it has handled those events completely. If the incoming event is not 
an event that your handleEvent() 
is interested in, you should call super.handleEvent() 
and return its return value. The following code shows how you might override 
handleEvent() to deal with 
a LIST_SELECT event: 
public boolean handleEvent (Event e) {
    if (e.id == Event.LIST_SELECT) {   // take care of LIST_SELECT
        System.out.println ("Selected item: " + e.arg);
        return true;    // LIST_SELECT handled completely; no further action
    } else {   // make sure we call the overridden method to ensure
                // that other events are handled correctly
        return super.handleEvent (e);
    }
}
Basic Event Handlers
The convenience event handlers like mouseDown(), 
keyUp(), and lostFocus() 
are all implemented by the Component 
class. The default versions of these methods do nothing and return false. 
Because these methods do nothing by default, when overriding them you do 
not have to ensure that the overridden method gets called. This simplifies 
the programming task, since your method only needs to return false 
if it has not completely processed the event. However, if you start to 
subclass nonstandard components (for example, if someone has created a 
fancy AudioButton, and you're 
subclassing that, rather than the standard Button), 
you probably should explicitly call the overridden method. For example, 
if you are overriding mouseDown(), 
you should include a call to super.mouseDown(), 
just as we called super.handleEvent() 
in the previous example. This call is "good housekeeping"; 
most of the time, your program will work without it. However, your program 
will break as soon as someone changes the behavior of the AudioButton 
and adds some feature to its mouseDown() 
method. Calling the super class's event handler helps you write "bulletproof" 
code. 
The code below overrides the mouseDown() 
method. I'm assuming that we're extending a standard component, 
rather than extending some custom component, and can therefore dispense 
with the call to super.mouseDown(). 
public boolean mouseDown (Event e, int x, int y) {
    System.out.println ("Coordinates: " + x + "-" + y);
    if ((x &gt; 100) || (y &lt; 100))
        return false;    // we're not interested in this event; pass it on
    else                 // we're interested;
        ...              // this is where event-specific processing goes
        return true;     // no further event processing
}
Here's a debugging hint: when overriding an event handler, make sure 
that the parameter types are correct--remember that each convenience method 
has different parameters. If your overriding method has parameters that 
don't match the original method, the program will still compile correctly. 
However, it won't work. Because the parameters don't match, 
your new method simply overloads the original, rather than overriding it. 
As a result, your method will never be called.
