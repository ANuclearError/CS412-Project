10.2 MenuContainer
MenuContainer is an interface 
implemented by the three menu containers: Frame, 
Menu, and MenuBar; 
Java 1.1 adds a fourth, Component. 
You should never need to worry about the interface since it does all its 
work behind the scenes for you. You will notice that the interface 
does not define an add() method. 
Each type of MenuContainer 
defines its own add() method 
to add menus to itself. 
MenuContainer Methods
public abstract Font getFont () 
The getFont() method should 
provide an object's font. MenuItem 
implements this method, so all of its subclasses inherit it. MenuBar 
implements it, too, while Frame 
gets the method from Component. 
public abstract boolean postEvent (Event e) 
The postEvent() method should 
post Event e 
to the object. MenuComponent 
implements this method, so all of its subclasses inherit it. (Frame 
gets the method from Component.) 
public abstract void remove (MenuComponent component) 
The remove() method should 
remove the MenuComponent component 
from the object. If component 
was not contained within the object, nothing should happen.
