Synopsis
Class Name:
java.text.StringCharacterIterator
Superclass:
java.lang.Object

New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The StringCharacterIterator 
class can move bidirectionally through a character string. 
In other words, the class iterates through the characters in a String. 
The class implements the CharacterIterator 
interface. The class is used by BreakIterator 
to find boundaries in text strings.

Constructors
StringCharacterIterator
public StringCharacterIterator(String text)
Parameters
text
The String to use. 
Description
This constructor creates a StringCharacterIterator 
that uses the given string. The initial index of the iterator is at the 
beginning of the string, or in other words, at index 0. 
public StringCharacterIterator(String text, int pos)
Parameters
text
The String to use.
pos
The initial position. 
Description
This constructor creates a StringCharacterIterator 
that uses the given string. The initial index of the iterator is set to 
the given initial position. 
   public StringCharacterIterator(String text, int begin, int end, int pos)  
Parameters
text
The String to use.
begin
The beginning index.
end
The ending index.
pos
The initial position. 
Description
This constructor creates a StringCharacterIterator 
that uses the specified range of the given string. In other words, the 
iterator uses the sequence of text from the specified beginning index to 
the specified ending index. The initial index of the iterator is set to 
the given initial position. 
Instance Methods
clone
public Object clone()
Returns
A copy of this StringCharacterIterator. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.clone() 
Overrides
Object.clone() 
Description
This method creates a copy of this StringCharacterIterator 
and returns it. 
current
public char current()
Returns
The character at the current position of this 
StringCharacterIterator or 
DONE if the current position 
is not within the text sequence. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.current() 
Description
This method returns the character at the current position of this CharacterIterator. 
The current position is returned by getIndex(). 
equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Parameters
obj
The object to be compared with this object. 
Returns
true if the objects are equal; 
false if they are not. 
Overrides
Object.equals() 
Description
This method returns true if 
obj is an instance of StringCharacterIterator 
and is equivalent to this StringCharacterIterator. 
first
public char first()
Returns
The first character in this StringCharacterIterator. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.first() 
Description
This method returns the character at the first position in this StringCharacterIterator. 
The first position is returned by getBeginIndex(). 
The current position of the iterator is set to this position. 
getBeginIndex
public int getBeginIndex()
Returns
The index of the first character in this StringCharacterIterator. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.getBeginIndex() 
Description
This method returns the index of the beginning of the text for this StringCharacterIterator. 
getEndIndex
public int getEndIndex()
Returns
The index after the last character in this StringCharacterIterator. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.getEndIndex() 
Description
This method returns the index of the character following the end of the 
text for this StringCharacterIterator. 
getIndex
public int getIndex()
Returns
The index of the current character in this StringCharacterIterator. 
Description
This method returns the current position, or index, of this StringCharacterIterator. 
hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns
A hashcode for this object. 
Overrides
Object.hashCode() 
Description
This method returns a hashcode for this StringCharacterIterator. 
last
public char last()
Returns
The last character in this StringCharacterIterator. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.last() 
Description
This method returns the character at the ending position of this StringCharacterIterator. 
The last position is the value of getEndIndex()-1. 
The current position of the iterator is set to this position. 
next
public char next()
Returns
The next character in this StringCharacterIterator 
or DONE if the current position 
is already at the end of the text. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.next() 
Description
This method increments the current position of this StringCharacterIterator 
by 1 and returns the character at the new position. If the current position 
is already at getEndIndex(), 
the position is not changed and DONE 
is returned. 
previous
public char previous()
Returns
The previous character in this StringCharacterIterator 
or DONE if the current position 
is already at the beginning of the text. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.previous() 
Description
This method decrements the current position of this StringCharacterIterator 
by 1 and returns the character at the new position. If the current position 
is already at getBeginIndex(), 
the position is not changed and DONE 
is returned. 
setIndex
public char setIndex(int p)
Parameters
p
The new position. 
Returns
The character at the specified position in this StringCharacterIterator. 
Throws
IllegalArgumentException
If the given position is not between getBeginIndex() 
and getEndIndex()-1. 
Implements
CharacterIterator.setIndex() 
Description
This method sets the current position, or index, of this StringCharacterIterator 
to the given position.
