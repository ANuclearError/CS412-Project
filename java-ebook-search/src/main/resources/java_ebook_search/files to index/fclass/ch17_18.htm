Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.PropertyResourceBundle
Superclass:
java.util.ResourceBundle
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The PropertyResourceBundle 
class is a concrete subclass of ResourceBundle 
that represents a set of resources for a locale. The resources are specified 
as a set of key/value string pairs in a property file. Internally, 
a Properties object is used 
to retrieve the resources from the property file. 
When ResourceBundle.getBundle() 
is called, it attempts to find a resource bundle that most closely matches 
a particular locale. This can be either a ListResourceBundle 
subclass or a property file, represented by a PropertyResourceBundle. 
Once the resource bundle has been retrieved, its contents can be used by 
the application to present locale-specific information. 
PropertyResourceBundle
inherits a lot of functionality from ResourceBundle;
see the class description of ResourceBundle for
more information.
