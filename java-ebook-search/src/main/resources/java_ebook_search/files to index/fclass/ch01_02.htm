Chapter 1Introduction
1.2 The java.lang.reflect Package
The java.lang.reflect package is new in Java
1.1. It contains classes and interfaces that support the new
Reflection API.  Reflection refers to the ability
of a class to reflect upon itself, or look inside of itself, to see
what it can do. The new JavaBeans API depends upon the Reflection API,
as does the object-serialization functionality in Java 1.1.
The Reflection API makes it possible to discover the variables,
methods, and constructors of any class and manipulate those
members as appropriate. For example, you can use a
Method object to call a particular method
in an object, even if your code was not compiled with any
information about the class that contains that method.
The java.lang.reflect package also defines
an Array class that can be used to manipulate
arbitrary arrays.
All of the classes in java.lang.reflect work
in conjunction with the Class class in 
the java.lang package. 
See Chapter 13, The java.lang.reflect Package, for complete reference material on all of the
classes in the java.lang.reflect package.
