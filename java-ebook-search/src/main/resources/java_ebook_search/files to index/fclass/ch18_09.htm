GZIPInputStream
Name
GZIPInputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream
Superclass:
java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The GZIPInputStream class decompresses 
data that has been compressed using the GZIP format. To use it, simply 
construct a GZIPInputStream 
that wraps regular input stream and use the read() 
methods to read the compressed data. 
Class Summary
public class java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream 
             extends java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream {
  // Constants
  public static final int GZIP_MAGIC;
  // Variables
  protected CRC32 crc;
  protected boolean eos;
  // Constructors
  public GZIPInputStream(InputStream in);
  public GZIPInputStream(InputStream in, int size);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public int read(byte[] buf, int off, int len);
}
Constants
GZIP_MAGIC
public static final int GZIP_MAGIC
Description
A constant that contains the "magic number" that appears in 
the header of GZIP files. 
Variables
crc
protected CRC32 crc
Description
A checksum value of the uncompressed data. When an entire file has been 
read, this checksum is compared to a value stored in the GZIP trailer. 
If the values do not match, an exception is thrown from read(). 
eos
protected boolean eos
Description
A flag that indicates whether or not the end of the compressed stream has 
been reached. It is set to true 
when the compressed data and the GZIP trailer have been read. 
Constructors
GZIPInputStream
public GZIPInputStream(InputStream in) throws IOException
Parameters
in
The underlying input stream. 
Throws
IOException
If an error occurs while reading the GZIP header. 
Description
This constructor creates a GZIPInputStream 
that inflates data from the given InputStream. 
The GZIPInputStream uses a 
decompression buffer with the default size of 512 bytes. The GZIP header 
is read immediately. 
   public GZIPInputStream(InputStream in, int size) throws IOException  
Parameters
in
The underlying input stream.
size
The size of the input buffer. 
Throws
IOException
If an error occurs while reading the GZIP header. 
Description
This constructor creates a GZIPInputStream 
that inflates data from the given InputStream. 
The GZIPInputStream uses a 
decompression buffer of the given size. The GZIP header is read immediately. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterInputStream.close() 
Description
This method closes this stream and releases any system resources that are 
associated with it. 
read
public int read(byte[] buf, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
buf
An array of bytes to be filled from the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to read. 
Returns
The number of bytes read or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered 
immediately. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs or the checksum of the uncompressed data does 
not match that in the GZIP trailer. 
Overrides
InflaterInputStream.read(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method reads enough data from the underlying InputStream 
to return len bytes of uncompressed 
data. The uncompressed data is placed into the given array starting at 
off. The method blocks until 
some data is available for decompression.
