classes and interfaces that provide a powerful
infrastructure for networking in Java.  These include:
The URL class for basic access
to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
The URLConnection class, which supports
more complex operations on URLs.
The Socket class for connecting to particular
ports on specific Internet hosts 
and reading and writing data using streams.
The ServerSocket class for implementing servers
that accept connections from clients.
The DatagramSocket, 
MulticastSocket, 
and DatagramPacket
classes for implementing low-level networking.
The InetAddress class, which represents 
Internet addresses.
