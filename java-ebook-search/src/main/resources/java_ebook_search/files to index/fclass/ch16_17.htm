RuleBasedCollator
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.text.RuleBasedCollator
Superclass:
java.text.Collator
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The RuleBasedCollator class 
is a concrete subclass of Collator 
that can compare strings using a table of rules. The rules for 
many locales already exist. To get a useful Collator 
for a given locale, use the getInstance(Locale) 
factory method of Collator. 
If you need a special-purpose Collator 
or a Collator for a new locale, 
you can create your own RuleBasedCollator 
from a string that represents the rules. The rules are expressed in three 
primary forms: 
[relation] [text]
[reset] [text]
[modifier]
The rules can be chained together. The only modifier is the @ 
character, which specifies that all diacriticals are sorted backwards, 
as in French. 
The valid relations are: 
&gt;
Greater than as a primary difference 
;
Greater than as a secondary difference or difference in accent 
,
Greater than as a tertiary difference or difference in case 
=
Equal 
For example "&lt;a&lt;b" 
is two chained rules that state that 'a' 
is greater than all ignorable characters, 
and 'b' 
is greater than 'a'. 
To expand this rule to include capitals, 
use "&lt;a,A&lt;b,B". 
A reset, specified by the &amp; 
character, is used to insert rules in an existing list of chained rules. 
For example, we can add a rule to sort 'e' 
with an umlaut (Unicode 0308) after plain 'e'. 
The existing rules might look like 
"&lt;a&lt;b&lt;c&lt;d&lt;e&lt;f". 
We can add the following reset, 
"&amp;e;e\u0308", so that the complete 
rule table looks like 
"&lt;a&lt;b&lt;c&lt;d&lt;e&lt;f&amp;e;e\u0308".

Constructors
RuleBasedCollator
public RuleBasedCollator(String rules) throws ParseException
Parameters
rules
A string that contains the rules. 
Throws
ParseException
If the given rules are incorrectly formed. 
Description
This constructor creates a RuleBasedCollator 
with the given rules. 
Instance Methods
clone
public Object clone()
Returns
A copy of this RuledBasedCollator. 
Overrides
Collator.clone() 
Description
This method creates a copy of this RuledBasedCollator 
and returns it. 
compare
public int compare(String source, String target)
Parameters
source
The source string.
target
The target string. 
Returns
-1 if source is less than target, 
0 if the strings are equal, or 1 if source 
is greater than target. 
Overrides
Collator.compare() 
Description
This method compares the given strings according to the rules for this 
RuleBasedCollator and returns 
a value that indicates their relationship. If either of the strings are compared more than once, a CollationKey 
should be used instead. 
equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Parameters
obj
The object to be compared 
with this object. 
Returns
true if the objects are equal; 
false if they are not. 
Overrides
Collator.equals() 
Description
This method returns true if 
obj is an instance of RuleBasedCollator 
and is equivalent to this RuleBasedCollator. 
getCollationElementIterator
   public CollationElementIterator getCollationElementIterator( String source)  
Parameters
source
The source string. 
Returns
A CollationElementIterator 
for the given string. 
Description
This method generates a CollationElementIterator 
for the given string. 
getCollationKey
public CollationKey getCollationKey(String source)
Parameters
source
The source string. 
Returns
A CollationKey for the given 
string. 
Overrides
Collator.getCollationKey() 
Description
This method generates a CollationKey 
for the given string. The returned object can be compared with other CollationKey 
objects using CollationKey.compareTo(). 
This comparison is faster than using RuleBasedCollator.compare(), 
so if the same string is used for many comparisons, you should use 
CollationKey objects. 
getRules
public String getRules()
Returns
The rules string for this RuleBasedCollator. 
Description
This method returns a string that contains the rules that this RuleBasedCollator 
is using. 
hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns
A hashcode for this object. 
Overrides
Collator.hashCode() 
Description
This method returns a hashcode for this RuleBasedCollator.
