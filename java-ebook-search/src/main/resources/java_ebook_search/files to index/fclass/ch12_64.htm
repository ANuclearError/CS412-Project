Throwable
Name
Throwable
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.lang.Throwable
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
java.lang.Error, java.lang.Exception
Interfaces Implemented:
java.io.Serializable
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The Throwable class is the superclass of
all objects that can be thrown by the throw statement
in Java. This is a requirement of the throw statement.
A Throwable object can have an associated 
message that provides more detail about the particular error or exception
that is being thrown.
The Throwable class provides a method that
outputs information about the state of the system when an exception
object is created. This method can be useful in debugging Java
programs.
The subclasses of Throwable that are provided
with Java do not add functionality to Throwable.
Instead, they offer
more specific classifications of errors and exceptions.
Class Summary
public class java.lang.Throwable extends java.lang.Object 
                                 implements java.lang.Serializable {
    // Constructors
    public Throwable();
    public Throwable(String message);
    // Instance Methods
    public native Throwable fillInStackTrace();
    public String getLocalizedMessage();               // New in 1.1
    public String getMessage();
    public void printStackTrace();
    public void printStackTrace(PrintStream s);
    public void printStackTrace(PrintWriter s);        // New in 1.1
    public String toString();
}
Constructors
Throwable
public Throwable()
Description
Creates a Throwable object with no associated
message. This constructor calls fillInStackTrace()
so that information is available for printStackTrace().
public Throwable(String message)
Parameters
message
A message string to be associated with the object.
Description
Create a Throwable object with an associated
message. This constructor calls fillInStackTrace()
so that information is available for printStackTrace().
Instance Methods
fillInStackTrace
public native Throwable fillInStackTrace()
Returns
A reference to this object.
Description
This method puts stack trace information in this Throwable
object. It is not usually necessary to explicitly call this method,
since it is called by the constructors of the class. However, this
method can be useful when rethrowing an object. If the stack trace
information in the object needs to reflect the location that the
object is rethrows from, fillInStackTrace() should
be called.
getLocalizedMessage
public String getLocalizedMessage()
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Returns
A localized version of the String object 
associated with this Throwable object, 
or null if
there is no message associated with this object.
Description
This method creates a localized version of the message 
that was associated with this object by its constructor.
The getLocalizedMessage() method in
Throwable always returns the same
result as getMessage().  
A subclass must override
this method to produce a locale-specific message.  
getMessage
public String getMessage()
Returns
The String object associated with this
Throwable object, or null if
there is no message associated with this object.
Description
This method returns any string message that was associated
with this object by its constructor.
printStackTrace
public void printStackTrace()
Description
This method outputs the string representation of this Throwable
object and a stack trace to System.err.
public void printStackTrace(PrintStream s)
Parameters
s
A java.io.PrintStream object.
Description
This method outputs the string representation of this Throwable
object and a stack trace to the specified PrintStream
object.
public void printStackTrace(PrintStream w)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
s
A java.io.PrintWriter object.
Description
This method outputs the string representation of this Throwable
object and a stack trace to the specified PrintWriter
object.
toString
public String toString()
Returns
A string representation of this object.
Overrides
Object.toString()
Description
This method returns a string representation of this Throwable
object.
