StringWriter
Name
StringWriter
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.StringWriter
Superclass:
java.io.Writer
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The StringWriter class represents 
a stream whose data is written to a string. This class is similar to the 
CharArrayWriter class, which 
writes its data to a char array. 
The StringWriter class uses 
a StringBuffer to store its 
data; a String can be retrieved 
with the toString() method. 
Class Summary
public class java.io.StringWriter extends java.io.Writer {
  // Constructors
  public StringWriter();
  protected StringWriter(int initialSize);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void flush();
  public StringBuffer getBuffer();
  public String toString();
  public void write(int c); 
  public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len); 
  public void write(String str); 
  public void write(String str, int off, int len); 
}
Constructors
StringWriter
public StringWriter()
Description
This constructor creates a StringWriter 
with an internal buffer that has a default size of 16 characters. The buffer 
grows automatically as data is written to the stream. 
protected StringWriter (int initialSize)
Parameters
initialSize
The initial 
buffer size. 
Description
This constructor creates a StringWriter 
with an internal buffer that has a size of initialSize 
characters. The buffer grows automatically as data is written to the stream. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close()
Overrides
Writer.close() 
Description
This method does nothing. For most subclassesof Writer,
this method releases any system resources 
that are associated with the Writer 
object. However, the StringWriter's 
internal buffer may be needed for subsequent calls to toString(). 
For this reason, close() does 
nothing, and the internal buffer is not released until the StringWriter 
is garbage collected. 
flush
public void flush()
Overrides
Writer.flush() 
Description
This method does nothing. The StringWriter 
writes data directly into its internal buffer; thus it is never necessary 
to flush the stream. 
getBuffer
public StringBuffer getBuffer()
Returns
A reference to the internal data buffer. 
Description
This method returns a reference to the StringBuffer 
object that is used in this StringWriter. 
toString
public String toString()
Returns
A String constructed from the internal data buffer. 
Overrides
Object.toString() 
Description
This method returns a reference to a String object created 
from the characters stored in this object's internal buffer. 
write
public void write(int c)
Parameters
c
The value to write. 
Overrides
Writer.write(int) 
Description
This method writes the given value into the internal buffer. If the buffer 
is full, it is expanded. 
public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)
Parameters
cbuf
An array of characters to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the character array.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Overrides
Writer.write(char[], int, int) 
Description
This method copies len characters 
to this object's internal buffer from cbuf, 
starting off elements from 
the beginning of the array. If the internal buffer is full, it is expanded. 
public void write(String str)
Parameters
str
A String 
to write to the stream. 
Overrides
Writer.write(String) 
Description
This method copies the characters of str into 
this object's internal buffer. If the internal buffer is full, it 
is expanded. 
public void write(String str, int off, int len)
Parameters
str
A String to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the string.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Overrides
Writer.write(String, int, int) 
Description
This method copies len characters 
to this object's internal buffer from str, 
starting off characters from 
the beginning of the given string. If the internal buffer is full, it is 
expanded.
