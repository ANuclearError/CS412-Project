Description
The FilenameFilter interface 
is implemented by a class that wants to filter the filenames that should 
be included in a list of filenames. For example, the list() 
method of the File class can 
take a FilenameFilter object 
to filter the filenames that are listed. The java.awt.FileDialog 
class also uses a FilenameFilter 
to limit the choices that are presented to the user. 
Interface Declaration
public abstract interface java.io.FilenameFilter {
  // Methods
  public abstract boolean accept(File dir, String name);
}
Methods
accept
public abstract boolean accept(File dir, String name)
Parameters
dir
The directory that contains the file.
name
The name of the file. 
Returns
true if the file should be 
shown; false otherwise. 
Description
This method returns a boolean 
value that indicates whether or not a file should be included in a list 
of filenames. The method should return true 
if a file should be included; otherwise it should return false. 
A simple filter might return true 
for filenames with a certain extension, like .java. 
A more complex filter could check the directory name, the file's 
readability, and last modification time, for example.
