Description
The Character class provides an object
wrapper for a char value. This is useful when
you need to treat a char value as an object.
For example, there are a number of utility methods that take a reference
to an Object as one of their arguments. You cannot
specify a char value for one of these arguments,
but you can provide a reference to a Character object
that encapsulates the char value. Furthermore,
as of JDK 1.1, the Character class is necessary to 
support the Reflection API and class literals.
In Java, Character objects represent values defined
by the Unicode standard. Unicode is defined
 
by an organization called the Unicode Consortium. The defining document for
Unicode is The Unicode Standard, Version 2.0
(ISBN 0-201-48345-9). More recent information about Unicode is
available at http://unicode.org. Appendix A, The Unicode 2.0 Character Set, contains a table that lists the characters
defined by the Unicode 2.0 standard.
The Character class provides some utility
methods, such as methods for determining the type (e.g., uppercase
or lowercase, digit or letter) of a character and for converting
from uppercase to lowercase. The logic for these utility methods
is based on a Unicode attribute 
table that is part of the Unicode
standard. That table is available at
ftp://unicode.org/pub/2.0-Update/UnicodeData-2.0.14.txt.
Some of the methods in the Character class
are concerned with characters that are digits; these characters are used by
a number of other classes to convert strings that contain numbers
into actual numeric values. The digit-related methods all use a
radix value to interpret characters.
The radix is the numeric base used to represent numbers
as characters or strings. Octal is a radix 8 representation, while
hexadecimal is a radix 16 representation. The methods that require
a radix parameter use it to determine which characters
should be treated as valid digits. In radix 2, only the characters
`0' and `1' are valid digits. In radix 16, the characters `0' through
`9', `a' through `z', and `A' through `Z' are considerd valid digits.

Parameters
value
The char value to be encapsulated
by this object.
Description

char value.
Class Methods
digit
public static int digit(char ch, int radix)
Parameters
ch
A char value that is a legal
digit in the given radix.
radix
The radix used in interpreting the specified character
as a digit. If radix is in the range 2 through
10, only characters for which the isDigit() method
returns true are considered to be valid digits.
If radix is in the range 11 through 36, characters
in the ranges `A' through `Z' and `a' through `z' may be considered
valid digits.
Returns
The numeric value of the digit. This method returns -1 if
the value of ch is not considered a valid digit,
if radix is less than MIN_RADIX,
or if radix is greater than MAX_RADIX.
Description
Returns the numeric value represented by a digit character.
For example, digit('7',10) returns 7. If the
value of ch is not a valid digit, the method
returns -1. For example,
digit('7',2) returns
-1 because '7' is not a valid digit in radix 2. A number of methods
in other classes use this method to convert strings that contain
numbers to actual numeric values. The forDigit() method
is an approximate inverse of this method.
If radix is greater than 10, characters
in the range `A' to `A'+radix-11 are treated
as valid digits. Such a character has the numeric value ch-`A'+10.
By the same token, if radix is greater than 10,
characters in the range `a' to `a'+radix-11 are
treated as valid digits. Such a character has the numeric value
ch-`a'+10.
forDigit
public static char forDigit(int digit, int radix)
Parameters
digit
The numeric value represented as a digit character.
radix
The radix used to represent the specified value.
Returns
The character that represents the digit corresponding to the specified
numeric value. The method returns `\ 0' if digit is
less than 0, if digit is equal to or greater than
radix, if radix is less than
MIN_RADIX, or if radix is
greater than MAX_RADIX.
Description
This method returns the character that represents the digit
corresponding to the specified numeric value. If digit
is in the range 0 through 9, the method returns `0'+digit.
If digit is in the range 10
through MAX_RADIX-1,
the method returns `a'+digit-10. The method
returns `\ 0' if digit is less than 0, if
digit
is equal to or greater than radix,
if radix is less than MIN_RADIX,
or if radix is greater than MAX_RADIX.
getNumericValue
public static int getNumericValue(char ch)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters

Unicode specification.
isTitleCase
public static boolean isTitleCase(char ch)
Parameters
ch
A char value to be tested.
Returns
true if the specified character is defined
as titlecase in the Unicode character set; otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not the specified character
is a titlecase character. Unicode defines a number of characters that do not
have case mappings; if the specified character is one of these characters,
the method returns false.
Many characters are defined by the Unicode standard as having
upper- and lowercase forms. There are some characters defined
by the Unicode standard that also have a titlecase form. The glyphs
for these characters look like a combination of two Latin letters.
The titlecase form of these characters has a glyph that looks like
a combination of an uppercase Latin character and a lowercase
Latin character; this case should be used when the character appears
as the first character of a word in a title. For example, one of
the Unicode characters that has a titlecase form looks like the
letter `D' followed by the 
letter `Z'. Here is what the three forms
of this letter look like:
Uppercase
`DZ'
Titlecase
`Dz'
Lowercase
`dz'

toLowerCase
public static char toLowerCase(char ch)
Parameters
ch
A char value to be converted
to lowercase.
Returns
The lowercase equivalent of the specified character, or the
character itself if it cannot be converted to lowercase.
Description
This method returns the lowercase equivalent of the specified
character value. If the specified character is not uppercase or
if it has no lowercase equivalent, the character is returned unmodified.
The Unicode attribute table determines if a character has a mapping
to a lowercase equivalent.
Some Unicode characters in the range \u2000
through \u2FFF have lowercase mappings. For
example, \u2160 (Roman numeral one) has a lowercase
mapping to \u2170 (small Roman numeral one).
The toLowerCase() method maps such characters
to their lowercase equivalents even though the method isUpperCase()
does not return true for such characters.
toTitleCase
public static char toTitleCase(char ch)
Parameters
ch
A char value to be converted
to titlecase.
Returns
The titlecase equivalent of the specified character, or the
character itself if it cannot be converted to titlecase.
Description
This method returns the titlecase equivalent of the specified
character value. If the specified character has no titlecase equivalent,
the character is returned unmodified. The Unicode attribute table
is used to determine the character's titlecase equivalent.
Many characters are defined by the Unicode standard as having
upper- and lowercase forms. There are some characters defined
by the Unicode standard that also have a titlecase form. The glyphs
for these characters look like a combination of two Latin letters.
The titlecase form of these characters has a glyph that looks like
a combination of an uppercase Latin character and a lowercase
Latin character; this case should be used when the character appears
as the first character of a word in a title. For example, one of
the Unicode characters that has a titlecase form looks like the
letter `D' followed 
by the letter `Z'. Here is what the three forms
of this letter look like:
Uppercase
`DZ'
Titlecase
`Dz'
Lowercase
`dz'
toUpperCase
public static char toUpperCase(char ch)
Parameters
ch
A char value to be converted
to lowercase.
Returns
The uppercase equivalent of the specified character, or the
character itself if it cannot be converted to uppercase.
Description
This method returns the uppercase equivalent of the specified
character value. If the specified character is not lowercase or
if it has no uppercase equivalent, the character is returned unmodified.
The Unicode attribute table determines if a character has a mapping
to an uppercase equivalent.
Some Unicode characters in the range \u2000
through \u2FFF have uppercase mappings. For
example, \u2170 (small Roman numeral one) has
a lowercase mapping to \u2160 (Roman numeral
one). The toUpperCase() method maps such characters
to their uppercase equivalents even though the method isLowerCase()
does not return true for such characters.
