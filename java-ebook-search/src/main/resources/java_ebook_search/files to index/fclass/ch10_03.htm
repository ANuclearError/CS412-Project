10.3 Environment Variables
Java does not provide any way to directly access environment variables 
defined on a system. There is a System.getEnv() 
method that served that purpose before Java 1.0 was released. However, 
in released versions of Java, the System.getEnv() 
method just throws an exception with a message explaining that it is not 
supported. 
However, an environment variable can be made available as a system property 
if it is defined as a system property on the command line that invokes 
the Java virtual machine. For example, to make the environment variable 
PRINTER available as a system 
property in a Windows environment, you can write: 
C:\&gt; java -Dprinter=%PRINTER%
In a UNIX environment, you can use: 
% java -Dprinter=$PRINTER
