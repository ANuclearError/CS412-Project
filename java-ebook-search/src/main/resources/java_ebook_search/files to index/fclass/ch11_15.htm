[Chapter 11] Externalizable
Chapter 11The java.io Package
Externalizable
Name
Externalizable
Synopsis
Interface Name:
java.io.Externalizable
Super-interface:
java.io.Serializable
Immediate Sub-interfaces:
None
Implemented By:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The Externalizable interface 
is an extension of the Serializable 
interface. Whereas a Serializable 
object is automatically saved and loaded (in most cases), an Externalizable 
object has sole responsibility for saving and loading its state via the 
writeExternal() and readExternal() 
methods. If a class implements the Externalizable 
interface, it must handle any versioning issues that occur. 
The methods of Externalizable 
are public, which can pose 
a security risk. If security is a concern, Externalizable 
objects should not write or read sensitive information, or the Serializable 
interface should be used instead. 
Interface Declaration
public abstract interface java.io.Externalizable
                          extends java.io.Serializable {
  // Methods
  public abstract void readExternal(ObjectInput in);
  public abstract void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out);
}
Methods
readExternal
   public abstract void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException  
Parameters
in
The object input stream 
to use. 
Throws
ClassNotFoundException
If the class of the object being deserialized cannot be found.
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads an object from the given stream. This method has full 
responsibility for restoring the object's state. The implementation 
of readExternal() should read 
data in the format that is written out by writeExternal(). 
In general, an implementation should call methods of DataInput 
to read primitive types and methods of ObjectInput 
to read objects, strings, and arrays. 
writeExternal
   public abstract void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException  
Parameters
out
The object output stream 
to use. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method writes an object to the given stream. This method has full 
responsibility for saving the object's state. The implementation 
of writeExternal() should write 
data in the format that is read by readExternal(). 
In general, an implementation should call methods of DataOutput 
to write primitive types and methods of ObjectOutput 
to write objects, strings, and arrays.
