Chapter 11The java.io Package
PipedWriter
Name
PipedWriter
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.PipedWriter
Superclass:
java.io.Writer
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The PipedWriter class represents half of a
communication pipe; a PipedReader must be connected
to a PipedWriter. When the two halves of a
communication pipe are connected, data written to the
PipedWriter can be read from the
PipedReader. The communication pipe formed by a
PipedWriter and a PipedReader
should be used to communicate between threads. If both ends of a pipe
are used by the same thread, the thread can hang.
The PipedWriter class is the character-based
equivalent of the byte-based PipedOutputStream.
Class Summary

  // Constructors
  public PipedWriter();
  public PipedWriter(PipedReader sink);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void connect(PipedReader sink);
  public void flush();
  public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len;
}
Constructors
PipedWriter
public PipedWriter()
Description
This constructor creates a PipedWriter 
that is not connected to a PipedReader. 
The created object must be connected to a PipedReader 
before it can be used. 
public PipedWriter(PipedReader sink)
Parameters
sink
The PipedReader 
to connect. 
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This constructor creates a PipedWriter 
that sends data to the given PipedReader. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.close() 
Description
This method closes the writer and releases the system resources that are 
associated with it. 
connect
public void connect(PipedReader sink) throws IOException
Parameters
sink
The PipedReader 
to connect. 
Throws
IOException 
If another 
PipedReader is already connected 
to this PipedWriter or this 
PipedWriter is already connected. 
Description
This method connects this PipedWriter 
object to the given PipedReader. 
If this PipedWriter or sink 
is already connected, an exception is thrown. 
flush
public void flush() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
InterruptedIOException
While this method is waiting for buffer space to become available, if
the interrupted() method of the thread that invoked
this method is called.
Overrides
Writer.flush() 
Description
This method flushes the writer, which tells the connected PipedReader 
to notify its readers to read any available data. 
write
   public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException  
Parameters
cbuf
An array of characters to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the character array.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(char[], int, int) 
Description
This method writes len characters 
of output from the given array, starting at offset off. 
The method passes the given data to the connected PipedReader.
