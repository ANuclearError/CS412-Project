Synopsis
Class Name:
java.net.DatagramPacket
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later 
Description
The DatagramPacket class represents 
a packet of data that can be sent and received over the network using a 
DatagramSocket. The class is 
used to implement connectionless data communication. 
Class Summary

  // Constructors
  public DatagramPacket(byte[] ibuf, int ilength);
  public DatagramPacket(byte[] ibuf, int ilength, 
                        InetAddress iaddr, int iport);
  // Instance Methods
  public synchronized InetAddress getAddress();
  public synchronized byte[] getData();
  public synchronized int getLength();
  public synchronized int getPort();
  public synchronized void setAddress(InetAddress iaddr);   // New in 1.1

}
Constructors
DatagramPacket
public DatagramPacket(byte ibuf[], int ilength)
Parameters
ibuf
The data buffer for receiving incoming bytes.
ilength
The number of bytes to read. 
Description
This constructor creates a DatagramPacket 
that receives data. The value of ilength 
must be less than or equal to ibuf.length. 
This DatagramPacket can be 
passed to DatagramSocket.receive(). 
   public DatagramPacket(byte ibuf[], int ilength, InetAddress iaddr, int iport)  
Parameters
ibuf
The data buffer for the packet.
ilength
The number of bytes to send.
iaddr
The destination address.
iport
The destination port number. 
Description
This constructor creates a DatagramPacket 
that sends packets of length ilength 
to the given port of the specified address. The value of ilength 
must be less than or equal to ibuf.length. 
The packets are sent using DatagramSocket.send(). 
Instance Methods
getAddress
public synchronized InetAddress getAddress()
Returns
The IP address of the packet. 
Description
If this packet has been received, the method returns the address of the 
machine that sent it. If the packet is being sent, the method returns the 
destination address. 
getData
public synchronized byte[] getData()
Returns
The packet data. 
Description
This method returns the data buffer associated with this DatagramPacket 
object. This data is either the data being sent or 
the data that has been received. 
getLength
public synchronized int getLength()
Returns
The packet length. 
Description
This method returns the length of the message in the buffer associated 
with this DatagramPacket. This length
is either the length of the data being sent or the length of the data that 
has been received. 
getPort
public synchronized int getPort()
Returns
The port number of the packet. 
Description
If this packet has been received, the method returns the port number of 
the machine that sent it. If the packet is being sent, the method returns 
the destination port number. 
setAddress
public synchronized void setAddress(InetAddress iaddr)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1 
Parameters
iaddr
The destination address for the packet. 
Description
This method sets the destination address for this packet. When the packet 
is sent using DatagramSocket.send(), 
it is sent to the specified address. 
setData
public synchronized void setData(byte[] ibuf)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1 
Parameters
ibuf
The data buffer for the packet. 
Description
This method sets the data for this packet. When the packet is sent using 
DatagramSocket.send(), the 
specified data is sent. 
setLength
public synchronized void setLength(int ilength)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1 
Parameters
ilength
The number of bytes to send. 
Description
This method sets the length of the data to be sent for this packet. When 
the packet is sent using DatagramSocket.send(), 
the specified amount of data is sent. 
setPort
public synchronized void setPort(int iport)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1 
Parameters
iport
The port number for the packet. 
Description
This method sets the destination port number for this packet. When the 
packet is sent using DatagramSocket.send(), 
it is sent to the specified port.
