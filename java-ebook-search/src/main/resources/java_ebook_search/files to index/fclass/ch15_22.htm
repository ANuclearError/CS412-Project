Description
The URLEncoder class defines 
a single static method that 
converts a String to its URL-encoded 
form. More precisely, the String 
is converted to a MIME type called x-www-form-urlencoded. 
This is the format used when posting forms on the Web. The algorithm leaves 
letters, numbers, and the dash (-), 
underscore ( _ ), period (.), 
and asterisk (*) characters 
unchanged. Space characters are converted to plus signs (+). 
All other characters are encoded with a percent sign (%) 
followed by the character code represented as a two-digit hexadecimal number. 
For example, consider the following string: 
Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e
This string gets encoded as: 
Jean-Louis+Gas%8ee
The point of the URLEncoder 
class is to provide a way to canonicalize a string into an 
extremely portable subset of ASCII that can be handled properly by computers 
around the world.
