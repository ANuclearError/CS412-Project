Chapter 11The java.io Package
FilterWriter
Name
FilterWriter
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.FilterWriter
Superclass:
java.io.Writer
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The FilterWriter class is the 
superclass of all of the writer classes that filter output. A subclass 
of FilterWriter works by wrapping 
an existing writer, called the underlying writer, and providing additional 
functionality. The methods of FilterWriter 
simply override the methods of Writer 
with versions that call the corresponding methods of the underlying writer. 
FilterWriter cannot be instantiated 
directly; it must be subclassed. An instance of a subclass of FilterWriter 
is constructed with another Writer 
object. The methods of a subclass of FilterWriter 
should override some methods in order to extend their behavior or 
provide some sort of filtering. 
FilterWriter is like 
FilterOutputStream, except 
that it deals with a character stream instead of a byte stream. 
Class Summary
public abstract class java.io.FilterWriter extends java.io.Writer {
  // Variables
  protected Writer out;
  // Constructors
  protected FilterWriter(Writer out);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void flush();
  public void write(int c);
  public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len);
  public void write(String str, int off, int len);
}
Variables
out
protected Writer out
Description
The underlying writer that this FilterWriter 
wraps or filters. 
Constructors
FilterWriter
public FilterWriter(Writer out)
Parameters
out
The output writer to 
filter. 
Description
This constructor creates a FilterWriter 
that sends data to out. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.close() 
Description
This method calls the close() 
method of the underlying writer, which releases any system resources associated 
with this object. 
flush
public void flush() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.flush() 
Description
This method calls the flush() 
method of the underlying writer, which forces any characters that may be 
buffered by this FilterWriter 
to be written to the underlying device. 
write
public void write(int c) throws IOException
Parameters
c
The value to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(int) 
Description
This method writes a character containing the low-order 16 bits of the given 
integer value. It calls the write(int) 
method of the underlying writer. 
   public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException  
Parameters
cbuf
An array of characters to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the array.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(char[], int, int) 
Description
This method writes len characters 
contained in the given array, starting at offset off. 
It does this by calling the write(char[], int, int) 
method of the underlying writer. 
public void write(String str, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
str
A string to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the string.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(String, int, int) 
Description
This method writes len characters 
contained in the given string, starting at offset off. 
It does this by calling the write(String, int, int) 
method of the underlying writer.
