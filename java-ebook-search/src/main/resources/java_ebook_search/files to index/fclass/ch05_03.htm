5.3 Stacks
The Stack class is a subclass 
of Vector that implements a 
last-in-first-out (LIFO) object stack. The Stack 
class uses the following methods to provide stack behavior: 
The push() method pushes 
an object onto the top of the stack. 
The pop() method removes 
and returns the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, pop() 
throws an EmptyStackException. 
The peek() method returns, 
but does not remove, the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, 
peek() throws an EmptyStackException. 
The empty() method returns 
true if and only if the stack 
is empty.
