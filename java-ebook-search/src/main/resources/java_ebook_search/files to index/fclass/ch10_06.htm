10.6 Self Termination
The very last communication a program has with its environment occurs when 
it terminates itself. A Java application can terminate itself by calling 
the System.exit() method. This 
method terminates an application by exiting the Java virtual machine; its 
argument is the exit code that is returned to the environment that invoked 
the Java virtual machine. 
If a program is running in a browser or other environment that has a
SecurityManager installed, it may be denied the
ability to call System.exit().
