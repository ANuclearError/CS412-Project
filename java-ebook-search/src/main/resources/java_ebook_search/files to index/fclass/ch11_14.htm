Chapter 11The java.io Package
EOFException
Name
EOFException
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.EOFException
Superclass:
java.io.IOException
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
An EOFException is thrown in 
response to an attempt to read past the end of a file. 
Many file-handling routines indicate the end of a file with 
a special return code. For example, many read() 
methods return -1 to indicate 
that the end of file has been reached. However, in some cases, the program 
clearly expects a certain format of data in a file. If it's not all 
there, throwing an exception is an appropriate way to flag the unusual 
condition of the file. So, for example, a DataInputStream 
throws an EOFException if it 
comes to the end of file in the middle of readFloat(). 
In the java.io package, EOFException 
is used in the classes that implement the DataInput 
and ObjectInput interfaces, 
namely DataInputStream, ObjectInputStream, 
and RandomAccessFile.
