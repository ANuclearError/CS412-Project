1.5 The java.util Package
The java.util package contains 
a number of useful classes and interfaces that support fundamental
data structures and notification-related design patterns. Java depends 
directly on several of the classes in this package, and you may
find many of these indispensable. 
A number of classes in java.util are designed to
help you manage a collection of objects. For example, the
Vector class supports variable-length arrays
of objects, while the Hashtable class
can be used to create hashtables, or associative arrays, that 
contain key/value pairs of objects.
In addition, the Enumeration interface defines
methods for iterating through a collection of elements.
Chapter 5, Collections, provides more detailed information on using these
classes effectively in your Java programs.
The StringTokenizer class parses strings into distinct tokens separated by
delimiter characters. This class is described in more detail
in Chapter 2, Strings and Related Classes.
The java.util package contains a number of 
new classes in Java 1.1 to support internationalization.
Many of these classes work in conjuction with the classes
defined in the new java.text package.
The most important new class is the 
Locale class, which represents
a particular locale, or country and language, for
internationalization purposes. 
The new Calendar and 
TimeZone classes interpret 
the value of a Date
object in the context of a particular calendar system; 
the Date class existed in Java 1.0.2, but
many of its methods are deprecated in Java 1.1. 
Finally, the ResourceBundle class and its subclasses,
ListResourceBundle and
PropertyResourceBundle, represent
sets of localized data in Java 1.1.
Two other new entities in java.util are
the EventObject class and the
EventListener interface. These items 
form the basis of the new event model in Java 1.1.
See Chapter 17, The java.util Package, for complete reference material on all of the
classes in the java.util package.
