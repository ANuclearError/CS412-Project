1.4 The java.net Package
The java.net package contains 
classes and interfaces that provide a powerful
infrastructure for networking in Java. Many of the classes
in this package provide support for working with
sockets in Java. For example, the Socket
and ServerSocket classes make it possible
to implement client and server programs that communicate
using a reliable, connection-oriented protocol. The
DatagramSocket, DatagramPacket,
and MulticastSocket classes, on the
other hand, all provide support for communication over
a connectionless protocol. The MulticastSocket
class is new in Java 1.1.
The URL and URLConnection
classes define methods for working with uniform resource 
locators (URLs). The URL class supports basic 
access to data stored at a URL, while URLConnection
offers complete control over all aspects of working with a URL.
The InetAddress class represents 
network addresses, so InetAddress objects
are used by a number of the methods in other classes in
java.net.
Chapter 8, Networking, offers a short tutorial on using the networking classes
provided by the java.net package.
See Chapter 15, The java.net Package, for complete reference material on all of the
classes in this package.
