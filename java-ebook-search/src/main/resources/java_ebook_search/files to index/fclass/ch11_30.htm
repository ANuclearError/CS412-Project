Class Name:
java.io.InterruptedIOException

java.io.IOException

None

Description
An InterruptedIOException is thrown when an I/O
operation is interrupted. This can occur when a thread is waiting for
data to become available for a PipedInputStream or
PipedReader to read. It can also occur when a
thread is waiting for buffer space to become available for a
PipedOutputStream or PipedWriter
to write to. If the thread's interrupt() method is called while the
thread is waiting, the read() or write() method in question throws an
InterruptedIOException.
