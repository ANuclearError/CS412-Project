We invite you to help us improve our books. If you have an idea that
could make this a more useful language reference, or if you find a bug
in an example or an error in the text, let us know by sending mail to
bookquestions@ora.com.
As Java continues to evolve, we may find it necessary to issue errata
for this book or to release updated examples or reference
information. This information will be found on the book's web
site, http://www.ora.com/catalog/javafund/.
