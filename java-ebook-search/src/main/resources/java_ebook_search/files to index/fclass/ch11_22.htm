Name
FileReader
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.FileReader
Superclass:
java.io.InputStreamReader
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The FileReader class represents 
a character stream that reads data from a file. It is a subclass of InputStreamReader 
that uses a default buffer size (8192 bytes) to read bytes from a file 
and the default character encoding scheme to convert the bytes to characters. 
If you need to specify the character 
encoding or the buffer size, wrap an InputStreamReader 
around a FileInputStream. 
The file can be specified using a FileDescriptor, 
a File object, or a String 
that represents a pathname. All of the constructors can throw a SecurityException 
if the application does not have permission to read from the specified 
file. 
FileReader provides a low-level 
interface for reading character data from a file. You should think about 
wrapping a FileReader with 
a BufferedReader to increase 
reading efficiency. 
If you need to read binary data from a file, you should use a FileInputStream 
wrapped by a DataInputStream 
instead. 
Class Summary
public class java.io.FileReader extends java.io.InputStreamReader {
  // Constructors
  public FileReader(String fileName);
  public FileReader(File file);
  public FileReader(FileDescriptor fd);
}
Constructors
FileInputStream
public FileReader(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException
Parameters
fileName
A String that contains the pathname 
of the file to be accessed. The path must conform to the requirements of 
the native operating system. 
Throws
FileNotFoundException
If the named file cannot be found.
SecurityException
If the application does not have permission to read the named file. 
Description
This constructor creates a FileReader 
that gets its input from the file named by the specified String. 
public FileReader(File file) throws FileNotFoundException
Parameters
file
The File 
to use as input. 
Throws
FileNotFoundException
If the named file cannot be found.
SecurityException
If the application does not have permission to read the named file. 
Description
This constructor creates a FileReader 
that gets its input from the file represented by the specified File. 
public FileReader(FileDescriptor fdObj)
Parameters
fdObj
The FileDescriptor of the file to use as input. 
Throws
SecurityException
If the application does not have permission to read the specified file.
NullPointerException
If FileDescriptor is null. 
Description
This constructor creates a FileReader 
that gets its input from the file identified by the given FileDescriptor.
