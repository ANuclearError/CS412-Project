ZipFile
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.zip.ZipFile
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The ZipFile class represents 
a ZIP file. Unlike with a ZipInputStream, 
you can read the entries in a ZipFile 
nonsequentially. Internally, the class uses a RandomAccessFile 
so that you can read the entries from the file in any order. You can obtain 
a list of the entries in this ZIP file by calling entries(). 
Given an entry, you can get an InputStream 
for that entry using getInputStream().
