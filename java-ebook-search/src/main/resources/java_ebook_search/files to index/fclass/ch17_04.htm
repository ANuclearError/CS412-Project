Description
The Dictionary class is an 
abstract class that associates 
keys with values. Any non-null 
object can be used as a key or as a value. Key/value pairs can be 
stored in a Dictionary, and 
values can be retrieved or removed using their associated keys. 
A subclass of Dictionary should 
use the equals() method to 
decide if two keys are equivalent.
