Description
A RuleBasedCollator object creates
an instance of the CollationElementIterator 
class to iterate through the characters of a string and determine
their relative collation sequence. A
CollationElementIterator object performs callbacks
to the RuleBasedCollator that created it to get
the information it needs to recognize groups of characters that
are treated as single collation characters.
For example, a RuleBasedCollator for a
Spanish language locale would be set up to treat `ch'
as a single letter.  A CollationElementIterator 
object also gets information from its RuleBasedCollator
that is used to determine the collation ordering priority for characters.
A collation-ordering priority of a character is a composite integer value
that determines how the character is collated. This priority is comprised
of:
A primary order that distinguishes between different letters.
Characters that are considered to be different letters, such as
`e' and `f', have different primary orders. 
Different forms of the same letter, such as `e' 
and `E', or an accented form of `e', 
have the same primary order. Primary orders are short values.
A secondary order that distinguishes between accented forms of
the same letter. An unaccented `e' has a different
secondary order than forms of `e' that have different
accents. `E' and `e' have the same 
secondary order, as do upper- and lowercase forms of `e' 
that have the same accent.  Secondary orders are byte values.
A tertiary order that distinguishes between case differences.
`E' and `e' have different tertiary 
orders.  Tertiary orders are byte values. 
The next() method returns the collation-ordering
priority of the next logical character. Primary, secondary, and 
tertiary orders are extracted from an ordering priority
with the primaryOrder(), 
secondaryOrder(), and
tertiaryOrder() methods.

Constants
NULLORDER
public final static int NULLORDER
Description
A constant that is returned by next() 
if the end of the string has been reached. 
Class Methods
primaryOrder
public static final int primaryOrder(int order)
Returns
The primary order component of the given order key. 
Description
This method extracts the primary order value from the given order key. 
secondaryOrder
public static final short secondaryOrder(int order)
Returns
The secondary order component of the given order key. 
Description
This method extracts the secondary order value from the given order key. 
tertiaryOrder
public static final short tertiaryOrder(int order)
Returns
The tertiary order component of the given order key. 
Description
This method extracts the tertiary order value from the given order key. 
Instance Methods
next
public int next()
Returns
The order value of the next character in the string. 
Description
This method returns the order key for the next character in the string. 
The returned value can be broken apart using the primaryOrder(), 
secondaryOrder(), and tertiaryOrder() 
methods. 
reset
public void reset()
Description
This method resets the position of this CollationElementIterator 
to the beginning of the string.
