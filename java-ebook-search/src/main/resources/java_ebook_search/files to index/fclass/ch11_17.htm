Chapter 11The java.io Package
FileDescriptor
Name
FileDescriptor
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.FileDescriptor
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The FileDescriptor class encapsulates 
system-specific handles for files and sockets. Instances of this class 
can be properly constructed only by native methods of other classes. In 
other words, you should not be constructing your own file descriptors. 
Currently, file descriptors are returned by the following methods: 
DatagramSocketImpl.getFileDescriptor()
FileInputStream.getFD() 
FileOutputStream.getFD() 
RandomAccessFile.getFD() 
SocketImpl.getFileDescriptor() 
A file descriptor can be used in the constructors for FileInputStream, 
FileOutputStream, FileReader, 
and FileWriter. 
Class Summary
public final class java.io.FileDescriptor extends java.lang.Object {
  // Constants
  public final static FileDescriptor err;
  public final static FileDescriptor in;
  public final static FileDescriptor out;
  // Instance Methods
  public native void sync();                     // New in 1.1
  public native boolean valid();
}
Constants
err
public final static FileDescriptor err
Description
The file descriptor for standard error. See System.err, 
which is constructed from this constant. 
in
public final static FileDescriptor in
Description
The file descriptor for standard input. See System.in, 
which is constructed from this constant. 
out
public final static FileDescriptor out
Description
The file descriptor for standard output. See System.out, 
which is constructed from this constant. 
Instance Methods
sync
public native void sync() throws SyncFailedException
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1 
Throws
SyncFailedException 
If synchronization cannot be accomplished. 
Description
This method causes the underlying device to be updated to a current state,
which typically involves asking the operating system to flush its
buffer.
For example, if this FileDescriptor 
refers to a file on a physical disk, the disk is physically updated to 
reflect the current state of the object this descriptor represents. This 
method allows an application to put a device in a known state, which could 
be useful for transaction processing. 
valid
public native boolean valid()
Returns
true if the FileDescriptor represents a valid, open device; false otherwise. 
Description
This method returns a boolean 
value that indicates the validity of the file descriptor.
