Chapter 18The java.util.zip Package
DeflaterOutputStream
Name
DeflaterOutputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream
Superclass:
java.io.FilterOutputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream, 
java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The DeflaterOutputStream class 
represents an OutputStream 
with an associated Deflater. 
In other words, a DeflaterOutputStream 
wraps a regular output stream, so that data written to the stream is compressed 
and written to the underlying stream. Two subclasses, GZIPOutputStream 
and ZipOutputStream, write 
compressed data in widely-recognized formats. 
Class Summary
public class java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream 
             extends java.io.FilterOutputStream {
  // Variables
  protected byte[] buf;
  protected Deflater def;
  // Constructors
  public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out);
  public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out, Deflater def);
  public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out, Deflater def, int size);
  // Public Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void finish();
  public void write(int b);
  public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len);
  // Protected Instance Methods
  protected void deflate();
}
Variables
buf
protected byte[] buf
Description
A buffer that holds the compressed data that is written to the underlying 
stream. 
def
protected Deflater def
Description
The Deflater object that is 
used internally. 
Constructors
DeflaterOutputStream
public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out)
Parameters
out
The underlying output stream. 
Description
This constructor creates a DeflaterOutputStream 
that writes data to the given OutputStream. 
Before being written, the data is compressed by a default Deflater. 
The DeflaterOutputStream uses 
a compression buffer with the default size of 512 bytes. 
public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out, Deflater def)
Parameters
out
The underlying output stream.
def
The Deflater object. 
Description
This constructor creates a DeflaterOutputStream 
that writes data to the given OutputStream. 
Before being written, the data is compressed by the given Deflater. 
The DeflaterOutputStream uses 
a compression buffer with the default size of 512 bytes. 
   public DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream out, Deflater def, int size)  
Parameters
out
The underlying output stream.
def
The Deflater object.
size
The size of the output buffer. 
Description
This constructor creates a DeflaterOutputStream 
that writes data to the given OutputStream. 
Before being written, the data is compressed by the given Deflater. 
The DeflaterOutputStream uses 
a compression buffer of the given size. 
Public Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterOutputStream.close() 
Description
This method closes the stream and releases any system resources that are 
associated with it. 
finish
public void finish() throws IOException
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method finishes writing compressed data to the underlying stream without 
closing it. 
write
public void write(int b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
The value to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterOutputStream.write(int) 
Description
This method compresses a byte that contains the lowest eight bits of the 
given integer value and writes it to the underlying OutputStream. 
The method blocks until the byte is written. 
public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method takes len bytes 
from the given buffer, starting at off, 
and compresses them. The method then writes the compressed data to the 
underlying OutputStream. The 
method blocks until all of the bytes have been written. 
Protected Instance Methods
deflate
protected void deflate() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method asks the internal Deflater 
to compress the data in the buffer for this DeflaterOutputStream. 
The method then writes the compressed contents of the buffer to the underlying 
stream. The method is called by both write() 
methods.
