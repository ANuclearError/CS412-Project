20.11 java.awt.event.FocusAdapter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a trivial implementation of
FocusListener; it provides empty bodies for each
of the methods of that interface.  When you are not
interested in all of these methods, it is often easier to
subclass FocusAdapter than it is to implement
FocusListener from scratch.
public abstract class FocusAdapter extends Object implements FocusListener {
    // Default Constructor: public FocusAdapter()
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void focusGained(FocusEvent e);  // From FocusListener
            public void focusLost(FocusEvent e);  // From FocusListener
}
