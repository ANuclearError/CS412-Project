Chapter 31The java.util.zip Package
31.13 java.util.zip.ZipEntry (JDK 1.1)
This class describes a single entry (typically a compressed
file) stored within a ZIP file.  The various methods get and
set various pieces of information about the entry.  The
ZipEntry class is used by the ZipFile and
ZipInputStream, which read ZIP files, and by the
ZipOutputStream, which writes ZIP files.  
When reading a ZIP file, the ZipEntry objects
returned by the ZipFile or ZipInputStream
contain the name, size, modification time, and other
information about each entry in the file.  When writing a
ZIP file, on the other hand, you must create your own
ZipEntry objects, and initialize them to contain the
entry name and other appropriate information before writing
the contents of the entry.
