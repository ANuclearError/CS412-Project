30.20 java.util.ResourceBundle (JDK 1.1)
This abstract class allows subclasses to define sets of
localized resources which can then be dynamically loaded as
needed by internationalized programs.  Such resources may
include user-visible text and images that appear in an
application, and even more complex things such as Menu objects.
Use getBundle() to load a ResourceBundle
subclass that is appropriate for the default or the
specified locale.  Use getObject(),
getString(), and getStringArray()
to look up a named
resource in a bundle.  To define a bundle, provide
implementations of handleGetObject() and
getKeys().  It is often easier, however, to subclass
ListResourceBundle, or to provide a property file
that is used by PropertyResourceBundle.  The
name of any localized ResourceBundle class you
define should include the locale language code, and,
optionally, the locale country code.
public abstract class ResourceBundle extends Object {
    // Default Constructor: public ResourceBundle()
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected ResourceBundle parent;
    // Class Methods
            public static final ResourceBundle getBundle(String baseName) throws MissingResourceException;
            public static final ResourceBundle getBundle(String baseName, Locale locale);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public abstract Enumeration getKeys();
            public final Object getObject(String key) throws MissingResourceException;
            public final String getString(String key) throws MissingResourceException;
            public final String[] getStringArray(String key) throws MissingResourceException;
    // Protected Instance Methods
            protected abstract Object handleGetObject(String key) throws MissingResourceException;
            protected void setParent(ResourceBundle parent);
