Chapter 18The java.awt Package
18.28 java.awt.GridBagConstraints (JDK 1.0)
This class encapsulates the instance variables that tell a
GridBagLayout how to position a given
Component within its Container.  
gridx, gridy
These fields specify the grid position of the component.
The RELATIVE constant specifies a position to the
right or below the previous component.
gridwidth, gridheight
These fields specify the height and width of the component
in grid cells.  The constant REMAINDER specifies
that the component is the last one and should get all
remaining cells.
fill
This field specifies which dimensions of a component should
grow when the space available for it is larger than its
default size.  Legal values are the constants NONE,
BOTH, HORIZONTAL, and VERTICAL.
ipadx, ipady
These fields specify internal padding to add on each side
of the component in each dimension.  They increase the size
of the component beyond its default minimum size.
insets
This Insets object specifies margins to appear on
all sides of the component.
anchor
This field specifies how the component should be displayed
within its grid cells when it is smaller than those cells.
The CENTER constant and the compass-point constants
are legal values.
weightx, weighty
These fields specify how extra space in the container should
be distributed among its components in the X and Y
dimensions.  Larger weights specify that a component should
receive a proportionally larger amount of extra space.  A
zero weight specifies that the component should not receive
any extra space.  These weights specify the resizing
behavior of the component and its container.
