20.21 java.awt.event.MouseEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type indicates that the user has moved the
mouse or pressed one of the mouse buttons.
Call getID() to determine the specific type of mouse
event that has occurred.  This method returns one of the
following seven constants, which corresponds to a method in
either the MouseListener or
MouseMotionListener interface.
MOUSE_PRESSED
The user has pressed a mouse button.
MOUSE_RELEASED
The user has released a mouse button.
MOUSE_CLICKED
The user has pressed and released
a mouse button without any intervening mouse drag.
MOUSE_DRAGGED
The user has moved the mouse while
holding a button down
MOUSE_MOVED
The user has moved the mouse without holding any buttons
down.
MOUSE_ENTERED
The mouse pointer has entered the component.
MOUSE_EXITED
The mouse pointer has left the component
Use getX() and getY() or getPoint()
to obtain the coordinates of the mouse event.  Use
translatePoint() to modify these coordinates by a
specified amount.
Use getModifiers() and other methods and constants
inherited from InputEvent to determine the mouse
button or keyboard modifiers that were down when the event
occurred.  See InputEvent for details.  Note
that mouse button modifiers are not reported for
MOUSE_RELEASED events, since, technically, the mouse
button in question is no longer pressed.  This can be
surprising. 
Use getComponent(), inherited from
ComponentEvent, to determine over which component the event
occurred.
For mouse events of type MOUSE_CLICKED,
MOUSE_PRESSED, or MOUSE_RELEASED, call
getClickCount() to determine how many consecutive
clicks have occurred.
If you are using popup menus, use isPopupTrigger()
to test whether the current event represents the standard
platform-dependent popup menu trigger event.

    // Public Constructor
            public MouseEvent(Component source, int id, long when, int modifiers, int x, int y, 
            public MouseEvent'u'int clickCount, boolean popupTrigger);
