18.46 java.awt.Panel (JDK 1.0)
This class is a Container that is itself contained
within a container.  Unlike Frame and
Dialog, Panel is a container that does not
create a separate window of its own.  Panel is
suitable for holding portions of a larger interface within a
parent Frame or Dialog or within another
Panel.  (Note that Applet is a subclass of
Panel, and thus applets are displayed in a
Panel that is contained within a Web browser or
applet viewer.)  The default LayoutManager for a
Panel is FlowLayout.
public class Panel extends Container {
    // Public Constructors
            public Panel();
        1.1  public Panel(LayoutManager layout);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void addNotify();  // Overrides Container
}
