31.12 java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream (JDK 1.1)
This class is a subclass of
java.io.FilterInputStream; it reads a specified
stream of compressed input data (typically one that was
written with DeflaterOutputStream or a subclass) and
"filters" that data by uncompressing ("inflating") it.  To
create an InflaterInputStream, you must specify the
input stream it is to read from, and also an
Inflater object that is to perform the
uncompresssion.  Once an InflaterInputStream is
created, the read() and skip() methods are
the same as those of other input streams.
Note that the InflaterInputStream uncompresses raw
data.  Applications often prefer one of its
subclasses, GZIPInputStream or ZipInputStream,
which work with compressed data written in the standard gzip
and PKZip file formats.
public class InflaterInputStream extends FilterInputStream {
    // Public Constructors
            public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in, Inflater inf, int size);
            public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in, Inflater inf);
            public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in);
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected byte[] buf;
            protected Inflater inf;
            protected int len;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public int read() throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterInputStream
            public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterInputStream
            public long skip(long n) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterInputStream
    // Protected Instance Methods
            protected void fill() throws IOException;
