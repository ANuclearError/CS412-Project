6.3 Drawing Graphics
Example 6.2
shows a fancier version of our simple applet.
As you can see from
Figure 6.2 ,
we've made the graphical display more interesting. This
applet also does all of its drawing in the paint()
method. It demonstrates the use of Font and
Color objects.
This example also introduces the init() method,
which is used, typically in place of a constructor, to
perform any one-time initialization that is necessary when
the applet is first created. The paint() method may
be invoked many times in the life of an applet, so this
example uses init() to create the Font
object that paint() uses.

Example 6.2: An Applet with Fancier Graphics
import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.*;
public class SecondApplet extends Applet {
  static final String message = "Hello World";
  private Font font;
  // One-time initialization for the applet
  // Note: no constructor defined.
  public void init() {
    font = new Font("Helvetica", Font.BOLD, 48);
  }
  // Draw the applet whenever necessary.  Do some fancy graphics.
  public void paint(Graphics g) {
    // The pink oval
    g.setColor(Color.pink);
    g.fillOval(10, 10, 330, 100);
    // The red outline. Java doesn't support wide lines, so we
    // try to simulate a 4-pixel wide line by drawing four ovals.
    g.setColor(Color.red);
    g.drawOval(10, 10, 330, 100);
    g.drawOval(9, 9, 332, 102);
    g.drawOval(8, 8, 334, 104);
    g.drawOval(7, 7, 336, 106);
    // The text
    g.setColor(Color.black);
    g.setFont(font);
    g.drawString(message, 40, 75);
  }
}
