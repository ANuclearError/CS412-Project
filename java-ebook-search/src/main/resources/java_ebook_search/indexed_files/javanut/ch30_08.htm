30.8 java.util.EventObject (JDK 1.1)
EventObject serves as a superclass for all events
objects used by the Java 1.1 AWT event model and the JavaBeans
event model.  This class defines a very generic type of
event; it is extended by the more specific event classes in
the java.awt, java.awt.event, and
java.beans packages.
The only common feature shared by all events is a source
object, which is the object that in some way "generated" the
event.  The source object is passed to the
EventObject() constructor, and is returned by the
getSource() method.
public class EventObject extends Object implements Serializable {
    // Public Constructor
            public EventObject(Object source);
    // Protected Instance Variables
            protected transient Object source;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public Object getSource();
            public String toString();  // Overrides Object
}
