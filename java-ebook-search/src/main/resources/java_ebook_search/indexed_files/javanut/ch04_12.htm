Chapter 4What's New in Java 1.1
4.12 New JDK Utilities
JDK 1.1 includes a number of new tools.  In the discussion
of applets above, we've already seen jar for creating
JAR archives and javakey for adding digital
signatures to JAR archives.  In fact, javakey can do
much more than that--it is a very flexible tool for managing
a database of entities, generating keys and certificates,
and generating digital signatures.
serialver is a new tool used in conjunction with
object serialization.  When an object is deserialized, it is
important to verify that the version of the class file
for that object matches the version that was used to
serialize it.  This is done by computing a unique identifier
for the class and encoding it in a private variable of the
class.  When an incompatible change is made to the class, a
new unique identifier is computed, and the new value is
stored in the private variable.  It is the serialver
tool that is used to compute this unique identifier.
native2ascii is a tool for programmers who
program in a locale that uses a non-ASCII file encoding.
The javac compiler can only compile files encoded in
ASCII, with all Unicode characters converted to the
\uxxxx format.  What native2ascii does is to convert its input file to Unicode, and then output
that Unicode version as an ASCII file that uses the
\u escape for all non-ASCII Unicode characters.
After you process a locally-encoded file with
native2ascii, javac can compile it.
In addition to the tools described here, JDK 1.1 also
includes two new programs, rmic and
rmiregistry, that are used in conjunction with
Remote Method Invocation.  They will be documented in
Java Enterprise in a Nutshell.
