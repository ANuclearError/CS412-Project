18.37 java.awt.LayoutManager2 (JDK 1.1)
This interface is an extension of the LayoutManager
interface.  It defines additional layout management methods
for layout managers that perform constraint-based layout.
GridBagLayout is an example of a
constraint-based layout manager--each component added to the
layout is associated with a GridBagConstraints
object that specifies the "constraints" on how the component
is to be laid out.
Java programs do not directly invoke the methods of this
interface--they are used by the Container
object for which the layout manager is registered.
public abstract interface LayoutManager2 extends LayoutManager {
    // Public Instance Methods
            public abstract void addLayoutComponent(Component comp, Object constraints);
            public abstract float getLayoutAlignmentX(Container target);
            public abstract float getLayoutAlignmentY(Container target);
            public abstract void invalidateLayout(Container target);
            public abstract Dimension maximumLayoutSize(Container target);
