18.55 java.awt.Shape (JDK 1.1)
This interface encapsulates some very generic information
about geometric shapes.  All Shape objects must have
a bounding box--i.e., a rectangle that completely encloses
the represented shape.
When the forthcoming Java2D API is integrated with the AWT,
this interface may be changed.  For this reason, Java 1.1
applications can use this interface, but should not
implement it in their own classes.
public abstract interface Shape {
    // Public Instance Methods
            public abstract Rectangle getBounds();
}
