24.47 java.io.OutputStreamWriter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a character output stream that uses a byte
output stream as the destination for its data: when
characters are written to an OutputStreamWriter, it
translates them into bytes according to a particular locale-
and/or platform-specific character encoding, and writes those
bytes to the specified OutputStream.  This is a very
important internationalization feature in Java 1.1.
When you create an OutputStreamWriter, you specify
the OutputStream to which it writes bytes, and
you optionally specify the name of the character encoding
that should be used to convert characters to bytes.  If you
do not specify an encoding name, the
OutputStreamWriter uses the default encoding of
the default locale, which is usually the correct thing to
do.
OutputStreamWriter supports the usual Writer
methods.  It also has a getEncoding() method which
returns the name of the encoding being used to convert
characters to bytes.
public class OutputStreamWriter extends Writer {
    // Public Constructors
            public OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream out, String enc) throws UnsupportedEncodingException;
            public OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream out);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void flush() throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public String getEncoding();
            public void write(int c) throws IOException;  // Overrides Writer
            public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void write(String str, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides Writer
