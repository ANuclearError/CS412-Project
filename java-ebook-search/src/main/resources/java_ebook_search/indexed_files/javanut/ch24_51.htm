PipedWriter is a character output stream that writes
characters to the PipedReader character input stream
to which it is connected.  PipedWriter implements
one half of a pipe, and is useful for communication between
two threads of an application.
A PipedWriter cannot be used until it is connected
to a PipedReader object, which may be passed to the
PipedWriter() constructor, or to the
connect() method.
PipedWriter inherits most of the methods of its
superclass.  See Writer for more information.
PipedWriter is the character stream analog of
PipedOutputStream. 
public class PipedWriter extends Writer {
    // Public Constructors
            public PipedWriter();
            public PipedWriter(PipedReader sink) throws IOException;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void connect(PipedReader sink) throws IOException;
            public void flush() throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
            public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Defines Writer
