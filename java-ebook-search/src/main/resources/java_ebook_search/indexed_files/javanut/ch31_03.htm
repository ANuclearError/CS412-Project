31.3 java.util.zip.CheckedOutputStream (JDK 1.1)
This class is a subclass of
java.io.FilterOutputStream that allows data to be
written to a stream and a checksum computed on that data at
the same time.
To create a CheckedOutputStream you must specify the
output stream that it is to write its data to, and you must
also specify a Checksum object, such as an instance of
Adler32, that implements the particular checksum
algorithm you desire.  The write() methods are
similar to those of other OutputStream classes.  The
getChecksum() method returns the Checksum
object.  Note that you must call getValue() on this
object in order to obtain the actual checksum value.
public class CheckedOutputStream extends FilterOutputStream {
    // Public Constructor
            public CheckedOutputStream(OutputStream out, Checksum cksum);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public Checksum getChecksum();
            public void write(int b) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
            public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides FilterOutputStream
}
