29.2 java.text.CharacterIterator (JDK 1.1)
This interface defines an API for portably iterating through
the characters that comprise a string of text, regardless of
the encoding of that text.  Such an API is necessary because
the number of bytes per character is different for different
encodings, and some encodings even use variable-width
characters within the same string of text.  In addition to
allowing iteration, a class that implements the
CharacterIterator interface for non-Unicode text also performs
translation of characters from their native encoding to
standard Java Unicode characters.
CharacterIterator is similar to
java.util.Enumeration, but is somewhat more complex
than that interface.  The first() and last()
methods return the first and last characters in the text,
and the next() and prev() methods allow you
to loop forward or backwards through the characters of the
text.  These methods return the DONE constant when
they go beyond the first or last character in the text--a
test for this constant can be used to terminate a loop.
The CharacterIterator interface also allows random
access to the characters in a string of text.  The
getBeginIndex() and getEndIndex() methods return
the character positions for the start and end of the string,
and setIndex() sets the current position.
getIndex() returns the index of the current
position, and current() returns the character at
that position.
