This class is a type of FilterInputStream that
allows you to read binary representations of Java primitive data
types in a portable way.  Create a DataInputStream
by specifying the InputStream that is to be filtered
in the call to the constructor.
Many of this class's methods read and return a single Java
primitive type, in binary format, from the stream.
readUnsignedByte() and readUnsignedShort()
read unsigned values and return them as int values,
since unsigned byte and short types are not
supported in Java. read() reads data into an array
of bytes, blocking until at least some data are available.
By contrast, readFully() reads data into an array of
bytes, but blocks until all of the requested data become
available. skipBytes() blocks until the specified number of
bytes have been read and discarded.
readLine() reads characters from the stream until
it encounters a newline, a carriage return, or a newline
carriage return pair. The returned string is not terminated
with a newline or carriage return.  This method is
deprecated in Java 1.1; see BufferedReader for an
alternative.  readUTF() reads a string of Unicode
text encoded in a slightly modified version of the UTF-8
"transformation format." UTF-8 is an ASCII-compatible
encoding of Unicode characters that is often used for the
transmission and storage of Unicode text.  This class uses a
modified UTF-8 encoding that never contains embedded null characters.
DataInputStream only reads primitive Java types.  Use
ObjectInputStream to read object values.
