28.5 java.net.DatagramPacket (JDK 1.0)
This class implements a "packet" of data that may be sent or
received over the network through a DatagramSocket.
One of the DatagramPacket constructors specifies an
array of binary data to be sent with its destination address
and port. A packet created with this constructor may then
be sent with the send() method of a
DatagramSocket. The other DatagramPacket
constructor specifies an array of bytes into which data
should be received. The receive() method of
DatagramSocket waits for data and stores it in a
DatagramPacket created in this way. The contents
and sender of a received packet may be queried with the
DatagramPacket instance methods.
