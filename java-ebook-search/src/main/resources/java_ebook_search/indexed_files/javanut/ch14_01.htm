Working with System Properties
Java programs cannot read environment variables the way that
native programs can.  The reason is that environment
variables are platform dependent. Similar mechanisms exist,
however, that allow applications to read the
value of a named resource.  These resource values allow
customization of an application's behavior based
on site-specific parameters, such as the type of host, or
based on user preferences.
These named resource values are specified for applications
in the "system properties" list.  Applications
can read these "system
properties" with the System.getProperty() method, or
can read the entire list of properties with
System.getProperties().
System.getProperty() returns the property value as a
string.  Applications can also read properties in parsed
form using methods that are based on System.getProperty(),
such as Font.getFont(), Color.getColor(),
Integer.getInteger(), and
Boolean.getBoolean().
14.1 Standard System Properties
When the Java interpreter starts, it inserts a number of standard
properties into the system properties list.  These
properties, and the meaning of their values, are listed in
Table 14.1.
The table also specifies whether untrusted applets are
allowed (at least by default) to read the value of these
properties.  For reasons of security, untrusted code is only
allowed to read the values of properties to which it has
explicitly been granted access.  (Untrusted applets are not
allowed to set the value of system properties, nor are they
allowed to call System.getProperties() to obtain the
entire list of properties.)
