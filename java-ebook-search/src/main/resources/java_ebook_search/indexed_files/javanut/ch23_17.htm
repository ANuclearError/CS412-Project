23.17 java.beans.PropertyEditorManager (JDK 1.1)
The PropertyEditorManager class is never meant to be
instantiated; it defines static methods for registering and
looking up PropertyEditor classes for a specified
property type.  
A Java bean may specify a particular PropertyEditor
class for a given property by specifying it in a
PropertyDescriptor object for the property.  If it
does not do this, the PropertyEditorManager
is used to register and look up editors.  A bean or an
application builder tool may call the
registerEditor() method to register a
PropertyEditor for properties of a specified type.
Application builders and bean Customizer classes may
call the findEditor() method to obtain a
PropertyEditor for a given property type.
If no editor has been registered for a given type, the
PropertyEditorManager attempts to locate one.
For a type x, it looks for a class
xEditor first in the same package as
x, and then in each package listed in the
property editor search path.
public class PropertyEditorManager extends Object {
    // Default Constructor: public PropertyEditorManager()
    // Class Methods
            public static PropertyEditor findEditor(Class targetType);
            public static String[] getEditorSearchPath();
            public static void registerEditor(Class targetType, Class editorClass);
            public static void setEditorSearchPath(String[] path);
