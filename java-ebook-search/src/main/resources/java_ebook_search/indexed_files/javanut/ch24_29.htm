24.29 java.io.InputStreamReader (JDK 1.1)
This class is a character input stream that uses a byte
input stream as its data source: it reads bytes from a
specified InputStream and translates them into
Unicode characters according to a particular platform- and
locale-dependent character encoding.  This is a very
important internationalization feature in Java 1.1.
When you create an InputStreamReader, you specify an
InputStream from which the InputStreamReader
is to read bytes, and you also optionally specify the name
of the character encoding used by those bytes.  If you do
not specify an encoding name, the InputStreamReader
uses the default encoding for the default locale, which
is usually the correct thing to do.
The InputStreamReader supports the standard
Reader methods.  It also has a getEncoding()
method that returns the name of the encoding being used to
convert bytes to characters.
public class InputStreamReader extends Reader {
    // Public Constructors
            public InputStreamReader(InputStream in);
            public InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String enc) throws UnsupportedEncodingException;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void close() throws IOException;  // Defines Reader
            public String getEncoding();
            public int read() throws IOException;  // Overrides Reader
            public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Defines Reader
            public boolean ready() throws IOException;  // Overrides Reader
}
