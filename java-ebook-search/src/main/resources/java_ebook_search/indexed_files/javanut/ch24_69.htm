24.69 java.io.Writer (JDK 1.1)
This abstract class is the superclass of all character
output streams.  It is an analog to OutputStream,
which is the superclass of all byte output streams.
Writer defines the basic write(),
flush(), and close() methods that all
character output streams provide.
The five versions of the write() method write a
single character, a character array or subarray, or a
string or substring to the destination of the
stream.  The most general version of this method--the one
that writes a specified portion of a character array--is
abstract and must be implemented by all subclasses.  By
default, the other write() methods are implemented
in terms of this abstract one.
The flush() method is another abstract method that
all subclasses must implement.  It should force any output
buffered by the stream to be written to its destination.  If
that destination is itself a character or byte output
stream, it should invoke the flush() method of the
destination stream as well.
The close() method is also abstract.  Subclasses
must implement this method so that it flushes and then
closes the current stream, and also closes whatever
destination stream it is connected to.  Once the stream has
been closed, any future calls to write() or
flush() should throw an IOException.
