24.22 java.io.FileWriter (JDK 1.1)
FileWriter is a convenience subclass of
OutputStreamWriter that is useful when you want to
write text (as opposed to binary data) to a file.  You
create a FileWriter by specifying the file to be
written to, and optionally specifying whether the data
should be appended to the end of an existing file instead of
overwriting that file.
The FileWriter class creates an internal
FileOutputStream to write bytes to the specified
file, and uses the functionality of its superclass,
OutputStreamWriter, to convert the Unicode characters
written to the stream characters into bytes using the
default encoding of the default locale.  (If you want to use
an encoding other than the default, you cannot use
FileWriter; in that case you must create your own
OutputStreamWriter and FileOutputStream.)
Because FileWriter is a trivial subclass of
OutputStreamWriter, it does not define any methods
of its own, but simply inherits them from its superclass.
public class FileWriter extends OutputStreamWriter {
    // Public Constructors
            public FileWriter(String fileName) throws IOException;
            public FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append) throws IOException;
            public FileWriter(File file) throws IOException;
            public FileWriter(FileDescriptor fd);
}
