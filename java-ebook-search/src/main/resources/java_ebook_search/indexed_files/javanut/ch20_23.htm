20.23 java.awt.event.MouseMotionAdapter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a trivial implementation of
MouseMotionListener; it provides empty bodies for each
of the methods of that interface.  When you are not
interested in all of these methods, it is often easier to
subclass MouseMotionAdapter
than it is to implement
MouseMotionListener from scratch.
public abstract class MouseMotionAdapter extends Object implements MouseMotionListener {
    // Default Constructor: public MouseMotionAdapter()
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseMotionListener
            public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e);  // From MouseMotionListener
}
