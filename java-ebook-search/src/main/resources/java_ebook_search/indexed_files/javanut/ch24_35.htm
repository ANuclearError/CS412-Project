24.35 java.io.LineNumberReader (JDK 1.1)
This class is a character input stream that keeps track of
the number of lines of text that have been read from it.  It
supports the usual Reader methods, and also the
readLine() method introduced by its superclass.  In
addition to these methods, you can call
getLineNumber() to query the number of lines set so 
far.  You can also call setLineNumber() to set the
line number for the current line.  Subsequent lines are
numbered sequentially from this specified starting point.
This class is a character-stream analog to
LineNumberInputStream, which has been deprecated in Java 1.1.
public class LineNumberReader extends BufferedReader {
    // Public Constructors
            public LineNumberReader(Reader in);
            public LineNumberReader(Reader in, int sz);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public int getLineNumber();
            public void mark(int readAheadLimit) throws IOException;  // Overrides BufferedReader
            public int read() throws IOException;  // Overrides BufferedReader
            public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException;  // Overrides BufferedReader
            public String readLine() throws IOException;  // Overrides BufferedReader
            public void reset() throws IOException;  // Overrides BufferedReader
            public void setLineNumber(int lineNumber);
            public long skip(long n) throws IOException;  // Overrides BufferedReader
