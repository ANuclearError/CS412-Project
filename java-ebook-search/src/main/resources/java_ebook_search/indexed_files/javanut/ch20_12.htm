20.12 java.awt.event.FocusEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type indicates that a Component has
gained or lost focus on a temporary or permanent basis.
Use the inherited getComponent() method to determine
which component has gained or lost focus.  Use
getID() to determine the type of focus event; it
returns FOCUS_GAINED or FOCUS_LOST.
When focus is lost, you can call isTemporary() to
determine whether it is a temporary loss of focus.
Temporary focus loss occurs when the window that contains
the component loses focus, for example, or when focus is
temporarily diverted to a popup menu or a scrollbar.
Similarly, you can also use isTemporary() to
determine whether focus is being granted to a component on
a temporary basis.  
public class FocusEvent extends ComponentEvent {
    // Public Constructors
            public FocusEvent(Component source, int id, boolean temporary);
            public FocusEvent(Component source, int id);
    // Constants
            public static final int FOCUS_FIRST;
            public static final int FOCUS_GAINED;
            public static final int FOCUS_LAST;
            public static final int FOCUS_LOST;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public boolean isTemporary();
            public String paramString();  // Overrides ComponentEvent
}
