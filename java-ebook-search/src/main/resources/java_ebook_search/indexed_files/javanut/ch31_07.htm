Chapter 31The java.util.zip Package
31.7 java.util.zip.Deflater (JDK 1.1)
This class implements the general ZLIB data compression
algorithm used by the gzip and PKZip compression programs.
The constants defined by this class are used to specify the
compression strategy to be used and the compression
speed/strength trade-off level to be used.  If you set the
nowrap argument to the constructor to true,
then the ZLIB header and checksum data are omitted from
the compressed output, which is the format that both gzip
and PKZip use.
The important methods of this class are setInput(),
which specifies input data to be compressed, and
deflate(), which compresses the data and returns the
compressed output.  The remaining methods exist so that
Deflater can be used for stream-based compression,
as it is in higher-level classes such as
GZIPOutputStream and ZipOutputStream.  These
stream classes are sufficient in most cases.  Most
applications do not need to use Deflater directly.
The Inflater class uncompresses data compressed with
a Deflater object.
