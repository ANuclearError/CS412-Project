13.2 Character Escape Sequences
Java uses the escape sequences listed in Table 13.2
to represent certain special character values.  These escape
sequences may appear in any Java char or
String literal.
Table 13.2: Java Escape Characters
Escape Sequence
Character Value
\b
Backspace
\t
Horizontal tab
\n
Newline
\f
Form feed
\r
Carriage return
\"
Double quote
\'
Single quote
\\
Backslash
\xxx
The character corresponding to the octal value xxx,
where xxx is between 000 and 0377.
\uxxxx
The Unicode character with encoding xxxx, where
xxxx is one to four hexidecimal digits.  Unicode
escapes are distinct from the other escape types listed
here; they are described below in more detail.
Java characters, strings, and identifiers (e.g., field,
method, and class names) are composed of 16-bit Unicode
characters.  The Unicode \u escape sequence may be
used anywhere in a Java program (not only in char
and String literals) to represent a Unicode character.
Unicode \u escape sequences are processed before
the other escape sequences described in
Character Escape Sequences,
and thus the two types of escape sequences can have very
different semantics.  A Unicode escape is simply an
alternative way to represent a character which may not be
displayable on non-Unicode systems.  The character
escapes, however, can represent special characters in a way
that prevents the usual interpretation of those characters
by the compiler.
