6.2 A First Applet
Figure 6.1
shows what is probably the simplest possible applet you can
write in Java.
Example 6.1
lists its code. This example introduces the paint()
method, which is invoked by the applet viewer (or Web
browser) when the applet needs to be drawn. This method
should perform graphical output--such as drawing text or
lines or displaying images--for your applet. The argument
to paint() is a Graphics object that you
use to do the drawing.
Figure 6.1: A simple applet
Example 6.1: The Simplest Applet
import java.applet.*;   // Don't forget this import statement!
import java.awt.*;          // Or this one for the graphics!
public class FirstApplet extends Applet {
  // This method displays the applet.
  // The Graphics class is how you do all drawing in Java.
  public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawString("Hello World", 25, 50);
  }
}
To display an applet, you need an HTML file that references
it. Here is an HTML fragment that can be used with our
first applet:
&lt;APPLET code="FirstApplet.class" width=150 height=100&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
With an HTML file that references the applet, you can now
view the applet with an applet viewer or Web browser. Note
that the width and height attributes of this
HTML tag are required.  See Chapter 15, Java-Related HTML Tags for more details on the HTML
&lt;APPLET&gt; tag.  For most applet examples in this
book, we show only the Java code and not the
corresponding HTML file that goes with it.  Typically, that
HTML file contains a tag as simple as the one shown here.
