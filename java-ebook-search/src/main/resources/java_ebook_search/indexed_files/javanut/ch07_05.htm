7.5 Scribbling with Inner Classes
The Java 1.1 event model was designed to work well with
another new Java 1.1 feature: inner classes.
Example 7.3
shows what the applet looks like when the event listeners
are implemented as anonymous inner classes.  Note how
succinct this representation is. This is perhaps
the most common way to use the Java 1.1 event model, so
you'll probably
see a lot of code that looks like this.  In this case, our
simple applet is nothing but event-handling code, so this
version of it consists almost entirely of anonymous class
definitions.
Note that we've added a feature to the applet.  It now
includes a Clear button.  An
ActionListener object is registered with the button; it
clears the
scribble when the appropriate event occurs.
Example 7.3: Scribble: Using Inner Classes
import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
public class Scribble3 extends Applet {
  int last_x, last_y;
  public void init() {
    // Define, instantiate, and register a MouseListener object.
    this.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
      public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        last_x = e.getX();
        last_y = e.getY();
      }
    });
    // Define, instantiate, and register a MouseMotionListener object.
    this.addMouseMotionListener(new MouseMotionAdapter() {
      public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {
        Graphics g = getGraphics();
        int x = e.getX(), y = e.getY();
        g.setColor(Color.black);
        g.drawLine(last_x, last_y, x, y);
        last_x = x; last_y = y;
      }
    });
    // Create a clear button.
    Button b = new Button("Clear");
    // Define, instantiate, and register a listener to handle button presses.
    b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {  // clear the scribble
        Graphics g = getGraphics();
        g.setColor(getBackground());
        g.fillRect(0, 0, getSize().width, getSize().height);
      }
    });
    // And add the button to the applet.
    this.add(b);
  }
}
