24.28 java.io.InputStream (JDK 1.0)
This abstract class is the superclass of all input streams.
It defines the basic input methods that all input stream
classes provide.
read() reads a single byte or an array or subarray
of bytes. It returns the byte read, or the number of bytes
read, or -1 if the end-of-file has been reached.
skip() skips a specified number of bytes
of input. available() returns the number of bytes
that can be read without blocking. close() closes
the input stream and frees up any system resources
associated with it. The stream should not be used after
close() has been called.
If markSupported() returns true for a given
InputStream, that stream supports
mark() and reset() methods. mark()
marks the current position in the input stream so that
reset() can return to that position as long as no
more than the specified number of bytes have been read
between the mark() and reset().
