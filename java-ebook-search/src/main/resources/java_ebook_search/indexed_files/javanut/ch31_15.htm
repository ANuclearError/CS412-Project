31.15 java.util.zip.ZipFile (JDK 1.1)
This class reads the contents of ZIP files.  It uses a
random access file internally so that the entries of the ZIP
file do not have to be read sequentially as they do with the
ZipInputStream class.
A ZipFile object can be created by specifying the
ZIP file to be read either as a String filename or
as a File object.  Once created, the
getEntry() method returns a ZipEntry object
for a named entry, and the entries() method returns
an Enumeration object that allows you to loop
through all the ZipEntry objects for the file.  To
read the contents of a specific ZipEntry within the
ZIP file, pass the ZipEntry to
getInputStream()--this returns an
InputStream object from which you can read the
entry's contents.
