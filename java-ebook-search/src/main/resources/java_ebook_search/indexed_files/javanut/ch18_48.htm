18.48 java.awt.Polygon (JDK 1.0)
This class defines a polygon as an
array of points.  The points of the polygon may be specified
by the constructor, or with the addPoint() method.
getBoundingBox() returns the smallest
Rectangle that contains the polygon, and
inside() tests whether a specified point is within
the Polygon.  Note that the arrays of X and Y points
and the number of points in the polygon (not necessarily the
same as the array size) are defined as public variables.
Polygon objects are used when drawing polygons with
the Graphics.drawPolygon() and
Graphics.fillPolygon() methods.

    // Public Constructors
