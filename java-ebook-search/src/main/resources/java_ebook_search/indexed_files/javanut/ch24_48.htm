24.48 java.io.PipedInputStream (JDK 1.0)
This class is an InputStream that implements one-half of 
a pipe, and is useful for communication between
threads. A PipedInputStream must be connected to a
PipedOutputStream object, which may be specified
when the PipedInputStream is created or with the
connect() method. Data read from a
PipedInputStream object are received from the
PipedOutputStream to which it is connected.
See InputStream for information on the low-level
methods for reading data from a PipedInputStream. A
FilterInputStream may be used to provide a
higher-level interface for reading data from a
PipedInputStream.

    // Public Constructors

    // Protected Instance Methods
