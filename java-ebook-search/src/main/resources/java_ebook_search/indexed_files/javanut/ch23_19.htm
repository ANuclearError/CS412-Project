Chapter 23The java.beans Package
23.19 java.beans.PropertyVetoException (JDK 1.1)
The PropertyVetoException signals that a
VetoableChangeListener that received a
PropertyChangeEvent for a "constrained" property of
a bean has vetoed that proposed change.  
When this exception is received, the property in question
should revert back to its original value, and any
VetoableChangeListener objects that have already
been notified of the property change must be re-notified to
indicate that the property has reverted to its old value.
The VetoableChangeSupport class handles this
re-notification automatically and re-throws the
PropertyVetoException to notify its caller that the
change was rejected.
public class PropertyVetoException extends Exception {
    // Public Constructor
            public PropertyVetoException(String mess, PropertyChangeEvent evt);
    // Public Instance Methods
            public PropertyChangeEvent getPropertyChangeEvent();
}
