Preface
Part I: Introducing Java
Part I is an introduction to Java and Java programming. If you know
how to program in C or C++, these chapters teach you everything you need
to know to start programming with Java.
If you are already familiar with Java 1.0 you may want to just skip ahead
to Part II, which introduces the new features of Java 1.1.
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Java
Chapter 2: How Java Differs from C
Chapter 3: Classes and Objects in Java
Part II: Introducing Java 1.1
The two chapters in this part introduce the new features of Java 1.1.
Chapter 4 is an overview of the new APIs, and Chapter 5 explains the new
language syntax. See Part III for some examples of the new features.
Chapter 4: What's New in Java 1.1
Chapter 5: Inner Classes and Other New Language Features
Part III: Programming with the Java 1.1 API
Part III contains examples of
programming with the new features of Java 1.1.  You can
study and learn from the examples, and you should feel free
to adapt them for use in your own programs.  The examples
shown in these chapters may be downloaded from the Internet.
See http://www.ora.com/catalog/books/javanut2/.
Some of the chapters in this part also contain tables and other
reference material for new features in Java 1.1.
Part III of this book is "deprecated." Most of the examples
from the first edition of this book do not appear here, and
Part III may disappear altogether in the next edition of the
book.  Unfortunately, as Java continues to grow, there is less
and less room for programming examples in this book. However,
all of the examples from the first edition are still available
on the Web page listed above.

Chapter 7: Events
Chapter 8: New AWT Features

Part IV: Java Language Reference
Part IV contains reference material on the Java language and
related topics. Chapter 13 contains a number of useful

the syntax of the HTML tags that allow you to
include Java applets in Web pages. Chapter 16 documents the
command-line syntax for the Java compiler, interpreter, and
other tools shipped with the JDK.
