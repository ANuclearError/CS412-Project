The Graphics object returned by the
getGraphics() method of PrintJob always
implements this PrintGraphics interface.  You can
use this fact to distinguish a Graphics object that
draws to the screen from one that generates hardcopy. This
is a useful thing to do in a paint() method when you
want to generate hardcopy that differs somewhat from what is
displayed on-screen.
The getPrintJob() method defined by this interface
can also be used, of course, to return the PrintJob
with which the PrintGraphics object is associated.
