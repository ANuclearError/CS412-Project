Synopsis
jar c|t|x[f][m][v] [jar-file] [manifest-file] [files]
Description
jar is a tool that can be used to create and manipulate
Java Archive (JAR) files.  A JAR file is a compressed ZIP
file with an additional "manifest" file.  The syntax of
the jar command is reminiscent of the Unix tar
(tape archive) command.
Options to jar are specified as a block of
concatenated letters passed as a single
argument, rather than as individual command-line arguments.
The first letter of this option argument specifies
what action jar is to perform and is required.
Other option letters are optional.  The various file
arguments depend on which option letters are specified.
Options
The first argument to jar is a set of letters that
specifies the operation it is to perform.  The first letter
specifies the basic action and is required.  The three
possible values are the following:
c
Create a new JAR archive.  A list of input files
and/or directories must be specified as the
final arguments to jar.
t
List the contents of a JAR archive.  If a JAR file is
specified with the f option, its contents are
listed.  Otherwise, the JAR file to be listed is read from
standard input.
x
Extract the contents of a JAR archive.  If a JAR file is
specified with the f option, its contents are
extracted.  Otherwise, the JAR file to be extracted is
read from standard input.
If the command is followed by a list
of files and/or directories, only those files or directories
are extracted from the JAR archive.  Otherwise,
all files in the archive are extracted.
This action specifier can be followed by optional command letters:
f
This option indicates that the JAR file to create,
list, or extract from is specified on the command line.
When f is used with c, t, or
x, the JAR filename must be the second command-line
argument to jar (i.e., it must follow the block of option letters).
If this option is not specified, jar writes the
JAR file it creates to standard output, or reads a JAR
file from standard input.
m
This option is only used with the c action.  It
indicates that jar should read the manifest file
(partial or complete) specified on the command line and use
that file as the basis for the manifest it includes in the
JAR file.  When this argument is specified after the
f option, the manifest filename should follow the
destination filename.  If m precedes the f
option, the manifest filename should precede the
destination filename.
v
Verbose.  If this letter is specified with a c
action, jar lists each file it adds to the
archive with compression statistics.  If it is used with a
t action, jar lists the size
and modification date for each file in the archive, instead
of simply listing the filename.  If v is used with
x, jar displays the name of each file it
extracts from the archive.
Examples
To create a simple JAR file:
% jar cvf my.jar *.java images
To list the contents of a file:
% jar tvf your.jar
To extract the manifest file from a JAR file:
% jar xf the.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
To create a JAR file with a partial manifest specified:
% jar cfmv YesNoDialog.jar manifest.stub oreilly/beans/yesno
