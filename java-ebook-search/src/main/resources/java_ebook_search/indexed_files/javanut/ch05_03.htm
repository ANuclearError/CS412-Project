5.3 Member Classes
While nested top-level classes are nested within a
containing class, we've seen that they are still top-level
classes, and that the nesting is purely a matter of
organizational convenience.  The same is not true of member
classes, however.  These classes are also nested, but they
are not declared static, and in this case, the
nesting is significant.  The main features of member classes
are:
Every instance of a member class is internally associated
with an instance of the class that defines or contains the member
class.
The methods of a member class can implicitly
refer to the fields defined within the member class, as well
as those defined by any enclosing class, including
private fields of the enclosing class.
Like nested top-level classes, member classes are commonly used
for helper classes required by the enclosing class.  You
use a member class instead of a nested top-level class
when the member class requires access to the instance fields of the
enclosing class, or when every instance of the helper class
must refer to an instance of the enclosing class.  When you use
a member class, this
reference from member class to enclosing class is
implemented automatically for you.
Let's return to the LinkedList example that we saw above.
Suppose we want to add the ability to loop through the
elements in the linked list using the
java.util.Enumeration interface.  To do this, we
define a separate class that implements this
interface, and then add a method to the LinkedList
class that returns an instance of the separate
Enumeration class.
Example 5.3
shows a typical Java 1.0-style implementation.
[3]
[3] 
For simplicity, this example implements a very simple
Enumeration class that is not thread-safe and that
may return incorrect results if items are added to or
removed from the list while an Enumeration object is
in use.
Example 5.3: A LinkedList Enumerator, as a Separate Top-Level Class
import java.util.*;
public class LinkedList {
  // Our nested top-level interface.  Body omitted here...
  public interface Linkable { ... } 
  // The head of the list.
  Linkable head;  
  // Method bodies omitted here.
  public void addToHead(Linkable node) { ... }
  public Linkable removeHead() { ...  }
  // This method returns an Enumeration object for this LinkedList.
  public Enumeration enumerate() { 
    return new LinkedListEnumerator(this); 
  }
}
// This class defines the Enumeration type we use to list the elements in
// a LinkedList.  Note that each LinkedListEnumerator object is associated
// with a particular LinkedList object which is passed to the constructor.
class LinkedListEnumerator implements Enumeration {
  private LinkedList container;
  private LinkedList.Linkable current;
  public LinkedListEnumerator(LinkedList l) { 
    container = l;
    current = container.head; 
  }
  public boolean hasMoreElements() { return (current != null); }
  public Object nextElement() {
    if (current == null) throw new NoSuchElementException("LinkedList");
    Object value = current;
    current = current.getNext();
    return value;
  }
}
The point to notice about the LinkedListEnumerator
class in
Example 5.3
is that we must explicitly pass a LinkedList object
to its constructor.
The problem with
Example 5.3
is that LinkedListEnumerator is defined as a
separate top-level class, when it really would be more
elegant to define it as part of the LinkedList class
itself.  In Java 1.1, this is easily done using a member
class, as shown in
Example 5.4.
Example 5.4: A LinkedList Enumerator, as a Member Class
import java.util.*;
public class LinkedList 
{
  // Our nested top-level interface.  Body omitted here...
  public interface Linkable { ... } 
  // The head of the list.  
  // This field could be private except for inner class-related compiler bugs.
  /* private */ Linkable head;  
  // Method bodies omitted here.
  public void addToHead(Linkable node) { ... }
  public Linkable removeHead() { ...  }
  // This method returns an Enumeration object for this LinkedList.
  // Note: no LinkedList object is explicitly passed to the constructor.
  public Enumeration enumerate() { return new Enumerator(); }
  // And here is the implementation of the Enumeration interface,
  // defined as a private member class.
  private class Enumerator implements Enumeration {
    Linkable current;
    // Note: the constructor implicitly refers to 'head' in containing class.
    public Enumerator() { current = head; }
    public boolean hasMoreElements() {  return (current != null); }
    public Object nextElement() {
      if (current == null) throw new NoSuchElementException("LinkedList");
      Object value = current;
      current = current.getNext();
      return value;
    }
  }
}
In this version of the example, notice how the
Enumerator class is nested within the LinkedList
class.  There is a real elegance to defining the helper
class so close to where it is used by the containing class.
[4]
Of course, if you compiled this example you'd find that the
Enumerator member class is compiled to a file named
LinkedList$Enumerator.class--while one class is nested
within the other in source code form, the same is not true
of their compiled byte-code forms.
[4] 
John Rose, the author of Sun's inner class specification,
points out that
the advantages of inner classes are not only their elegance,
but also their "conciseness, expressiveness, and
modularity."  He says, "Even prosy-minded programmers who
don't care a fig for prissy elegance...will appreciate the
fact that they can define their adapter classes right next
to the code that needs them, and that they won't have to
manually wire the adapter to the main object...and that
they won't have to pollute the name space of the package..."
Notice that no instance of the containing
LinkedList class is passed to the
Enumerator() constructor of the member class.  A
member class can refer to the members of its enclosing class
implicitly; no explicit reference is necessary.
Also note that the Enumerator class makes use of the
head field of the enclosing class, even though
head is declared private.  Because the
member class is defined within the enclosing class, it is
"inside" the class as far as the definition of
private fields and methods is concerned.  In
general, member classes, as well as local and anonymous
classes can use the private fields and methods (and
classes!) of their containing class.  Similarly, a
containing class can use the private fields, methods, and
classes of the classes it contains.  And any two classes
that are enclosed by the same third class can access each
other's private members.
[5]
[5] 
As noted earlier, however, bugs in javac in current
versions of JDK 1.1 prevent this kind of access to
private members.  Until these bugs are fixed, you
should use use package visibility instead of private
visibility.
How Member Classes Work
The Enumerator member class of LinkedList
can refer to the head field of LinkedList
because every instance of a member class implicitly refers
to an instance of the class that contains it--this is one of
the fundamental features of member classes.  It works
because the compiler automatically inserts a private field
in the member class to hold the required reference to the
containing object.  The compiler also automatically inserts
a hidden argument to all constructors of a member class and
passes the containing object as the value of this argument.
[6]
Once the compiler automatically adds this private field and
constructor argument to the code in
Example 5.4,
you can see that we end up with code very much like what we
saw in 
Example 5.3!
[6] 
If you're curious about this, use javap -p to
disassemble the class file of a member class.  It shows
you both the inserted private field and the extra
constructor argument.
Because the Java Virtual Machine has no notion of inner
classes, the Java 1.1 compiler also must take special action
to allow member classes (and local and anonymous classes) to
use the private fields and methods in their
enclosing classes (and vice versa).  When a private
field or method is used in a way that is allowed in Java
1.1, but is not allowed by the Java interpreter, the
compiler automatically inserts a special accessor method to
allow the access.
New Syntax for Member Classes
The most important feature of a member class is that it can
implicitly refer to fields in its containing object.  We
saw this in the following constructor from
Example 5.4:
public Enumerator() { current = head; }
In this example, head is a field of the
LinkedList class, and we assign it to the
current field of the Enumerator class.  What
if we want to make these references explicit?  We
could try code like this:
public Enumerator() { this.current = this.head; }
This code does not compile, however.  this.current
is fine; it is an explicit reference to the current
field in the newly created Enumerator object.  It is
the this.head expression that causes the problem--it
refers to a field named head in the
Enumerator object.  There is no such field, so
the compiler generates an error.  To prevent this problem,
Java 1.1 defines new syntax for explicitly referring to the
containing instance of the current instance of a member
class.  If we wanted to be explicit in our constructor, we'd
use the new syntax like this:
public Enumerator() { this.current = LinkedList.this.head; }
Similarly, we can use LinkedList.this to refer to
the containing LinkedList object itself.  In general, the
syntax is classname.this, where
classname is the name of a containing class.  Note
that member classes can themselves contain member classes,
nested to any depth, and no member class can have the same
name as any containing class.  Thus, the use of the class
name prepended to this is a perfectly general way to
refer to any containing instance, as the following nested
class example demonstrates:
public class A {
  public String name = "a";
  public class B {
    public String name = "b";
    public class C {
      public String name = "c";
      public void print_names() {
        System.out.println(name);        // "c": name field of class C
        System.out.println(this.name);   // "c": name field of class C
        System.out.println(C.this.name); // "c": name field of class C
        System.out.println(B.this.name); // "b": name field of class B
        System.out.println(A.this.name); // "a": name field of class A
      }
    }
  }
}
Another new piece of Java 1.1 syntax has to do with the way
member classes are created.  As we've seen, member classes
work the way they do because the compiler automatically
adds an argument to each member class constructor.  This
argument passes a reference to the containing instance to
the newly created member instance.  Now look again at our
definition of the enumerate() method in
Example 5.4:
public Enumeration enumerate() { return new Enumerator(); }
Nowhere in this new expression do we specify what
the containing instance of the new Enumerator
instance should be.  In this case, the this object is
used as the containing instance, which is what you would
expect to happen.  It is also what you want to occur in most
cases.  Nevertheless, Java 1.1 supports a new syntax that
lets you
explicitly specify the containing instance when creating an
instance of a member class.  We can make our method more
explicit by using the following code:
public Enumeration enumerate() { return this.new Enumerator(); }
The syntax is containing_instance
.new, where
containing_instance is an expression that evaluates
to an instance of the class that defines the desired member
class.  
Let's look at another example of this syntax.  Recall that we declared the
Enumerator member class to be private in
Example 5.4.
We did this for reasons of modularity and encapsulation.
Suppose, however, that we had given Enumerator
package visibility.  In that case, it would be accessible
outside of the LinkedList class, and we could
instantiate our own copy of it.  In order to create an
instance of the member class LinkedList.Enumerator,
however, we must specify the instance of LinkedList
that contains it (and is implicitly passed to its
constructor).  Our code might look like the following:
// First create a linked list, and add elements to it (omitted).
LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
// Create an enumerator for the linked list.  Note the syntax of the
// 'new' expression.
Enumerator e = list.new Enumerator();
As a more complex example, consider the following lines of
code used to create an instance of class C nested within an
instance of class B nested within an instance of class A:
A a = new A();        // Create an instance of A.
A.B b = a.new B();    // Create an instance of B within the instance of A.
A.B.C c = b.new C();  // Create an instance of C within the instance of B.
c.print_names();      // Invoke a method of the instance of c.
Note that in the new expressions we name the class
to be created relative to the instance that will contain
it.  That is, we say b.new C(), not b.new A.B.C()
.  
There is one final piece of new Java 1.1 syntax related to
member class instantiation and initialization.  Before we
consider it, however, let me point out that you should
rarely, if ever,
need to use this syntax.  It represents one of the
pathological cases that snuck into the language along with
all the elegant features of inner classes.
The new syntax for the new operator described above
allows us to specify the containing instance that is passed
to the constructor of a member class.  There is one
circumstance in which a constructor is invoked without the
use of the new operator--when it is invoked with the
super keyword from a subclass constructor.  As
strange as it may seem, it is possible for a top-level
class to extend a member class.  This means that the
subclass does not have a containing instance, but that its
superclass does.  When the subclass constructor invokes the
superclass constructor, it must specify the containing
instance.  It does this by prepending the containing
instance and a period to the super keyword.  If we
had not declared our Enumerator class to be a
private member of LinkedList, then we could
subclass it.  Although it is not clear why we would want to
do so, we could write code like the following:
// A top-level class that extends a member class
class SpecialEnumerator extends LinkedList.Enumerator {
  // The constructor must take the LinkedList argument explicitly, 
  // and then must pass it implicitly to the superclass constructor 
  // using the new 'super' syntax.
  public SpecialEnumerator(LinkedList l) { l.super(); }
  // Here we override one or the other of the LinkedList.Enumerator
  // methods to have some kind of special behavior.
     . . .
}
Scope Versus Inheritance
Having noted that a top-level class can extend a member
class, it is important to point out that with the
introduction of member classes there are two entirely
separate hierarchies that must be considered for any class.
The first is the class hierarchy, from superclass to
subclass, that defines the fields that a member class
inherits.  The second is the containment hierarchy, from
containing class to contained class, that defines the fields
that are in the scope of (and are therefore accessible to)
the member class.
The two hierarchies are entirely distinct from each other,
and it is important that you do not confuse them.  This
should not be a problem if you refrain from creating name
conflicts where a field or method in a superclass has the
same name as a field or method in a containing class.  If
such a name conflict does arise, however, the inherited
field or method hides (i.e., takes precedence over) the field or
method of the same name in the containing class or classes.
This behavior is logical because when a class inherits a field or
method, that field or method effectively becomes part of
that class.  Therefore, inherited fields and methods are in
the scope of the class that inherits them, and take
precedence over fields and methods by the same name in
enclosing scopes.
Because this can be quite confusing, Java does not leave it
to chance that you get it right!  Whenever there is a
name conflict between an inherited field or method and a
field or method in a containing class, Java 1.1 requires
that you explicitly specify which one you mean.  For
example, if a member class B inherits a field named
x and is contained within a class A that also
defines a field named x, you must use
this.x to specify the inherited field, or
A.this.x to specify the field in the containing
class.  An attempt to use the field x without an
explicit specification of the desired instance causes a
compilation error.
A good way to prevent confusion between the class hierarchy
and the containment hierarchy is to avoid deep containment
hierarchies.  If a class is nested more than two levels
deep, it is probably going to cause more confusion than it
is worth.  Furthermore, if a class has a deep class
hierarchy (i.e.,
if it has many superclass ancestors),
consider defining it as a top-level class rather than as a
member class.
Restrictions on Member Classes
There are two important restrictions on member classes.
First, they cannot have the same name as any containing
class or package.  This is an important rule, and one that
is not shared by fields and methods.
Second, member classes, like all inner classes, cannot
contain any static members 
(fields, methods, or classes).  The justification for this
restriction is that static fields, methods, and
classes are "top level" constructs, and it is therefore
reasonable that they only be defined at the "top
level"--i.e., within top-level classes.  Defining a static,
top-level member within a non-top-level member class would
simply promote confusion and bad programming style.  It is
clearer (and therefore required) to define all static
members within a top-level class.  (Which may be a nested
top-level class, of course.)
Member Classes and Visibility Modifiers
A member class, like any member of a class, may be
assigned one of three visibility levels: public,
[7]
protected, or private.  If none of these
visibility modifiers is specified, the default "package"
visibility is used.  However, as mentioned earlier, there
have been no changes to the Java Virtual Machine to support
member classes, and member classes are compiled to class
files just like top-level classes are.  As far as the Java
interpreter is concerned, therefore, member classes, like
top-level classes, can only have public or package
visibility.  Thus, a member class declared protected
is actually treated as a public class, and a member class
declared private actually has package visibility.
While this is unfortunate, and is something you should be
aware of, it does not constitute a major security flaw.
[7] 
Because member classes are nested, and because of their
nature as "helper" classes, it is unusual to ever declare a
member class public.
Note that this does not mean that you should never declare a
member class as protected or private.
Although the interpreter cannot enforce these visibility
attributes, the desired attributes are noted in the class
file.  This means that any conforming Java 1.1 compiler can
enforce the visibility attributes and prevent the member
classes from being accessed in unintended ways.
