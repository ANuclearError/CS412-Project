23.3 java.beans.Beans (JDK 1.1)
The Beans class is never meant to be instantiated;
its static methods provide miscellaneous JavaBeans
features.
The instantiate() method creates an instance of a
bean.  The specified bean name represents either a
serialized bean file or a bean class file; it is
interpreted relative to the specified ClassLoader
object.  
The setDesignTime() and isDesignTime()
methods are used to set and query a flag that indicates
whether beans are being used in an application builder
environment.  Similarly, setGuiAvailable() and
isGuiAvailable() set and query a flag that indicates
whether the Java Virtual Machine is running in an
environment in which a GUI is available.  (Note that
untrusted applet code cannot call setDesignTime() or
setGuiAvailable().)
The isInstanceOf() method is a replacement for the
Java instanceof operator for use with beans.
Currently, it behaves just like instanceof, but in
the future it may work with beans that consist of a set
of Java objects, each of which provides a different "view" of
a bean.  Similarly, the getInstanceOf() method is a
replacement for the Java cast operator.	It converts a
bean to a superclass or interface type.  Currently, it
behaves just like a cast, but you should use it for future
compatibility with multiclass beans.
public class Beans extends Object {
    // Default Constructor: public Beans()
    // Class Methods
            public static Object getInstanceOf(Object bean, Class targetType);
            public static Object instantiate(ClassLoader cls, String beanName)
            public static Object instantiate'u'throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
            public static boolean isDesignTime();
            public static boolean isGuiAvailable();
            public static boolean isInstanceOf(Object bean, Class targetType);
            public static void setDesignTime(boolean isDesignTime) throws SecurityException;
            public static void setGuiAvailable(boolean isGuiAvailable) throws SecurityException;
