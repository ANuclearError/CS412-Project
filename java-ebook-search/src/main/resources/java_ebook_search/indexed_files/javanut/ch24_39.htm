Chapter 24The java.io Package
24.39 java.io.ObjectInputStream (JDK 1.1)
ObjectInputStream is used to deserialize objects,
arrays, and other values from a stream that was previously
created with an ObjectOutputStream.  The
readObject() method deserializes objects and arrays
(which should then be cast to the appropriate type);
various other methods are used to read primitive data values
from the stream.  Note that only objects that implement the
Serializable interface or the Externalizable
interface can be serialized and deserialized.
The defaultReadObject() method may only be called
from the readObject() method of an object that is
currently being deserialized.  It allows an object to
perform additional processing after deserializing itself.
The registerValidation() method may also only be
called from the readObject() method of an object
being deserialized.  It registers an
ObjectInputValidation object (typically the object
being deserialized) to be notified when a complete tree of
objects has been deserialized and the original call to the
readObject() method of the ObjectInputStream
is about to return to its caller.
The remaining methods include miscellaneous stream manipulation
methods and several protected methods for use by subclasses
that want to customize the deserialization behavior of
ObjectInputStream.
