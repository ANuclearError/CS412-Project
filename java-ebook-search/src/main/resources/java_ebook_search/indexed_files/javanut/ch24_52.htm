This class is a FilterOutputStream that implements a
number of methods for displaying textual representation of
Java primitive data types. The print() methods
output a standard textual representation of each data type.
The println() methods do the same, and follow that
representation with a newline. The methods convert various
Java primitive types to String representations and
then output the resulting string. When an Object is
passed to a print() or println(), it is
converted to a String by calling its
toString() method.
PrintStream is the OutputStream type that
makes it easiest to output text. As such, it is the most
commonly used of the output streams. The System.out
variable is a PrintStream.
Note that in Java 1.0 this class does not handle Unicode
characters correctly--it discards the top 8 bits of all
16-bit characters, and thus works only with Latin-1
(ISO8859-1) characters.  Although this problem has been
fixed in Java 1.1, PrintStream has been superseded
in Java 1.1 with PrintWriter.  The constructors of
this class have been deprecated, but the class itself has
not, because it is still used by the System.out
and System.err standard output streams.
PrintStream and its PrintWriter
replacement output textual representations of Java data
types.  Use DataOutputStream to output binary
representations of data.
