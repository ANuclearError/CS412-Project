Chapter 31The java.util.zip Package
31.17 java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream (JDK 1.1)
This class is a subclass of DeflaterOutputStream
that writes data in ZIP file format to an output stream.
Before writing any data to the ZipOutputStream, you
must begin an entry within the ZIP file with
putNextEntry().  The ZipEntry object passed
to this method should specify at least a name for the entry.
Once you have begun an entry with putNextEntry(),
you can write the contents of that entry with the
write() methods.  When you reach the end of an
entry, you can begin a new one by calling
putNextEntry() again, or you can close the current
entry with closeEntry(), or you can close the stream
itself with close().
Before beginning an entry with putNextEntry(), you
can set the compression method and level with
setMethod() and setLevel().  The constants
DEFLATED and STORED are the two legal values
for setMethod().  If you use STORED,
the entry is stored in the ZIP file without any
compression.  If you use DEFLATED, you can also
specify the compression speed/strength trade-off by passing a
number from 1 to 9 to setLevel(), where 9 gives the
strongest and slowest level of compression.  You can also
use the constants Deflater.BEST_SPEED,
Deflater.BEST_COMPRESSION, and
Deflater.DEFAULT_COMPRESSION with the
setLevel() method.
Note that if you are simply storing an entry without
compression, the ZIP file format requires that you specify,
in advance, the entry size and CRC-32 checksum in the
ZipEntry object for the entry.  An exception is
thrown if these values are not specified or are incorrectly
specified.
