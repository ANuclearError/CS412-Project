20.29 java.awt.event.WindowEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type indicates that an important action has
occurred for a Window object.
Call getWindow() to determine the Window
object that is the source of this event.  Call
getID() to determine the specific type of event that
has occurred.  Each of the following seven constants
corresponds to one of the methods of the
WindowListener interface:
WINDOW_OPENED
This type indicates that the window has been created and
opened; it is only delivered the first time that a window is
opened.
WINDOW_CLOSING
This type indicates that the user has requested that the
window be closed through the system menu, or through a close
button on the window's border, or by invoking a
platform-defined keystroke, such as Alt-F4 in
Windows.  The application should respond to this event by
calling hide() or destroy() on the
Window object.
WINDOW_CLOSED
This event type is delivered after a window is closed by a
call to hide() or destroy().
WINDOW_ICONIFIED
This event type is delivered when the user iconifies the window.
WINDOW_DEICONIFIED
This event type is delivered when the user de-iconifies the window.
WINDOW_ACTIVATED
This event type is delivered when the window is
activated--that is, when it is given the keyboard focus and
becomes the "active" window.
WINDOW_DEACTIVATED
This event type is delivered when the window ceases to be
the active window, typically when the user activates some
other window.
