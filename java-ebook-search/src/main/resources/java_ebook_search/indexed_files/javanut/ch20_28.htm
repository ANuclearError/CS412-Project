20.28 java.awt.event.WindowAdapter (JDK 1.1)
This class is a trivial implementation of
WindowListener; it provides empty bodies for each
of the methods of that interface.  When you are not
interested in all of these methods, it is often easier to
subclass WindowAdapter than it is to implement
WindowListener from scratch.
public abstract class WindowAdapter extends Object implements WindowListener {
    // Default Constructor: public WindowAdapter()
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void windowActivated(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
            public void windowClosed(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
            public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
            public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
            public void windowIconified(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
            public void windowOpened(WindowEvent e);  // From WindowListener
}
