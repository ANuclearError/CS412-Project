24.15 java.io.Externalizable (JDK 1.1)
This interface defines the methods that must be implemented
by an object that wants complete control over the way it is
serialized.  The writeExternal() and
readExternal() methods should be implemented to
write and read object data in some arbitrary format, using
the methods of the DataOutput and DataInput
objects. Externalizable objects must serialize their own
fields, and are also responsible for serializing the fields
of their superclasses.
Most objects do not need to define a custom output format
and can use the Serializable interface instead of
Externalizable for serialization.
