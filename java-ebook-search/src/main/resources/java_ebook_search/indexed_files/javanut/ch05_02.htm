5.2 Nested Top-Level Classes and Interfaces
As explained above, a nested top-level class or interface is
just like a regular package-member class or interface,
except that, for convenience, it has been nested within
another class or interface.  Note that nested top-level
classes and interfaces must be declared static.
They can only be nested within other top-level classes and
interfaces (i.e., they cannot be declared within inner
classes), but they can be nested to any depth.
Example 5.1 
shows how you might define a nested top-level "helper" interface.
Note the use of the static
keyword in the declaration of the interface.  The example
also shows how this interface is used both within the class
that contains it and by external classes.  Note the use of
its hierarchical name in the external class.
Example 5.1: Defining and Using a Nested Top-Level Interface
public class LinkedList {
  // This nested top-level helper interface is defined as a static member.
  public interface Linkable {
    public Linkable getNext();
    public void setNext(Linkable node);
  }
  // The head of the list is a Linkable object.
  Linkable head;  
  // Method bodies omitted.
  public void insert(Linkable node) { ... } 
  public remove(Linkable node) { ... } 
}
// This class defines a type of node that we'd like to use in
// a linked list.  Note the nested interface name in the implements clause.
class LinkableInteger implements LinkedList.Linkable
{
  // Here's the node's data and constructor.
  int i;
  public LinkableInteger(int i) { this.i = i; }
  // Here are the data and methods required to implement the interface.
  LinkedList.Linkable next;
  public LinkedList.Linkable getNext() { return next; }
  public void setNext(LinkedList.Linkable node) { next = node; }
}
The import statement can be used to import nested
top-level classes and interfaces from the class that defines
them, just as it can be used to import package member
top-level classes and interfaces from the package that
defines them.
Example 5.2
shows a new definition of the LinkableInteger class
from
Example 5.1
that uses an import statement to allow it to refer
to the Linkable interface by its simple, unqualified
name (i.e., the name of the enclosing class is no longer needed).
Example 5.2: Importing a Static Member Class
import LinkedList.*;     // Or use import LinkedList.Linkable;
// Since we use an import statement, we can just type
// "Linkable" instead of "LinkedList.Linkable".
class LinkableInteger2 implements Linkable
{
  int i;
  public LinkableInteger2(int i) { this.i = i; }
  Linkable next;
  public Linkable getNext() { return next; }
  public void setNext(Linkable node) { next = node; }
}
Nested Top-Level Classes and .class Files
When you compile the LinkedList.java file shown in
Example 5.1, 
you'll find that two class files are generated.  The first
is named LinkedList.class, as expected.  The second,
however, is named LinkedList$Linkable.class.  The
$ in this name is automatically inserted by the Java
1.1 compiler.  
The Java Virtual Machine knows nothing about
nested top-level classes and interfaces or the various
types of inner classes. 
Therefore, the Java compiler must convert these new types
into standard, non-nested class files that the Java
interpreter can understand.  This is done through
source-code transformations that insert $ characters
into nested class names. These source-code transformations
may also insert hidden fields,
methods, and constructor arguments into the affected
classes.  Unless you are writing a Java 1.1 compiler,
however, you do not need to know the details 
of these source-code transformations, and you will typically
not even notice them, except in the names of class files.

complete details on the source-code transformations
performed by the Java 1.1 compiler to support inner classes.
