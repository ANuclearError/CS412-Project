10.5 Specifying Bean Information
The YesNoDialog class itself and the
AnswerEvent and AnswerListener classes it
relies on are all a required part of our bean.  When an
application that uses the bean is shipped, it has to
include all three of these class files.  There are other
kinds of classes, however, that are often bundled with a bean
that are not intended for use by the
application developer.  These classes are used
by the beanbox tool that manipulates the bean.
The bean class itself does not refer to any of
these auxiliary beanbox classes so that it is not dependent
on them and they do not have to be shipped with the bean in
finished products.
The first of these optional, auxiliary classes is a
BeanInfo class.  As explained earlier, a beanbox
discovers the properties, events, and methods exported by a
bean through "introspection" based on the Java Reflection
API.  A bean developer who wants to provide additional
information about a bean, or who wants to refine the
(somewhat rough) information available through introspection,
should define a class that implements the BeanInfo
interface to provide that information.  A BeanInfo
class typically subclasses SimpleBeanInfo, which
provides a no-op implementation of the BeanInfo
interface.  When you only want to override one or two
methods, it is easier to subclass SimpleBeanInfo
than to implement BeanInfo directly.
Beanbox tools rely on a naming convention in order to find the
BeanInfo class for a given bean: a BeanInfo class
should have the same name as the bean, with the string
"BeanInfo" appended. 
Example 10.5
shows an implementation of the YesNoDialogBeanInfo
class.
This BeanInfo class specifies a number of pieces of
information for our bean:
An icon that can be used to represent the bean.
A BeanDescriptor object, which includes a reference
to a Customizer class for the bean.  We'll see an
implementation of this class later in the chapter.
A list of the supported properties of the bean, along with a
short description of each one.  Some beanbox tools (but not Sun's
beanbox) display these strings to
the user in some useful way.
A method that returns the most commonly customized property
of the bean--this is called the "default" property.
References to PropertyEditor classes for two of the
properties.  We'll see implementations of these property
editor classes later in the chapter.
A list of the methods supported by the bean, again with a
short description of each one.
Besides specifying this information, a
BeanInfo class can also provide information about the
events it generates and specify a default event.  The
various FeatureDescriptor objects used to provide
information about such things as properties and methods can also
include other information not provided by
YesNoDialogBeanInfo, such as a localized display
name that is distinct from the programmatic name.
