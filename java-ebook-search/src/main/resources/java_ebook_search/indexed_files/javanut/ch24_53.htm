This class is a character output stream that implements a
number of print() and println() methods that
output textual representations of primitive values and
objects.  When you create a PrintWriter object, you
specify a character or byte output stream that it should
write its characters to, and also optionally specify whether
the PrintWriter stream should be automatically
flushed whenever println() is called.  If you specify
a byte output stream as the destination, the
PrintWriter() constructor automatically creates
the necessary OutputStreamWriter object to convert
characters to bytes using the default encoding.
PrintWriter implements the normal write(),
flush(), and close() methods that all
Writer subclasses do. It is more common to use
the higher-level print() and println()
methods, each of which converts its argument to a string
before outputting it.  println() has the additional
behavior of terminating the line (and optionally flushing
the buffer) after printing its argument.
The methods of PrintWriter never throw exceptions.
Instead, when errors occur, they set an internal flag that
you can check by calling checkError().
checkError() first flushes the internal stream, and
then returns true if any exception has occurred
while writing values to that stream. Once an error has
occurred on a PrintWriter object, all subsequent
calls to checkError() return true;
there is no way to reset the error flag.
PrintWriter is the character stream analog to
PrintStream, which it supersedes.  You can usually
trivially replace any PrintStream objects in a
program with PrintWriter objects.  This is
particularly important for internationalized programs.  The
only valid remaining use for the PrintStream class
is for the System.out and System.err
standard output streams.  See PrintStream for
details.
