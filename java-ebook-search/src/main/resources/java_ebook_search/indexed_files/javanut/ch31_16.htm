31.16 java.util.zip.ZipInputStream (JDK 1.1)
This class is a subclass of InflaterInputStream that
reads the entries of a ZIP file in sequential order.  A
ZipInputStream is created by specifying the
InputStream from which it is to read the contents of the ZIP
file.  Once the ZipInputStream is created, the
getNextEntry() method is used to begin reading of
data from the next entry in the ZIP file.  This method must
be called before read() is called to begin reading
of the first entry.  Note that getNextEntry()
returns a ZipEntry object that describes the entry
being read.  Also note that getNextEntry() returns
null when there are no more entries to be read from
the ZIP file.
The read() methods of ZipInputStream read
until the end of the current entry and then return
-1 indicating that there are no more data to read.
To continue with the next entry in the ZIP file, you must
call getNextEntry() again.  Similarly, the
skip() method only skips bytes within the current
entry.  closeEntry() can be called to skip the
remaining data in the current entry, but it is usually
easier simply to call getNextEntry() to begin the
next entry.
