20.26 java.awt.event.TextEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type indicates that the user has edited the
text value that appears in a TextField,
TextArea, or other TextComponent.  This
event is triggered by any change to the displayed text.  Note that this
is not the same as the ActionEvent sent by the
TextField object when the user edits the text and
strikes the Return key.
Use the inherited getSource() to determine the
object that was the source of this event.  You have to cast
that object to its TextComponent type.  Call
getID() to determine the type of a TextEvent.
The standard AWT components always generate text events of
type TEXT_VALUE_CHANGED.
public class TextEvent extends AWTEvent {
    // Public Constructor
            public TextEvent(Object source, int id);
    // Constants
            public static final int TEXT_FIRST;
            public static final int TEXT_LAST;
            public static final int TEXT_VALUE_CHANGED;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public String paramString();  // Overrides AWTEvent
}
