6.7 JAR Files
The Soundmap applet defined in the previous section
requires five files to operate: the class file for the
applet itself, the class files for the two nested classes it
contains, the image file, and the sound clip file.  It can be
loaded using an &lt;APPLET&gt; tag like this:
&lt;APPLET code="Soundmap.class" width=288 height=288&gt;
   ...
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
When the applet is loaded in this manner, however, each of the
five files is transferred in uncompressed form using a
separate HTML request.  As you might imagine, this is quite
inefficient.
In Java 1.1, you can instead combine the five files into a
single JAR (Java ARchive) file.  This single, compressed file
(it is a ZIP file) can be transferred from Web server to browser much
more efficiently.  To create a JAR file, use the jar
tool, which has a syntax reminiscent of the UNIX tar command:
% jar cf soundmap.jar *.class image.gif sound.au
This command creates a new file, soundmap.jar, that
contains all the .class files in the current
directory, and also contains the files image.gif and
sound.au.  jar can also be used to list and
extract the contents of a JAR file.  See Chapter 16, JDK Tools for complete documentation.
To use a JAR file, you specify it as the value of the
archive attribute of the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag:
&lt;APPLET archive="soundmap.jar" code="Soundmap.class" width=288 height=288&gt;
   ...
&lt;/APPLET&gt;
Note that the archive attribute does not replace the
code attribute.  archive specifies where to
look for files, but code is still required to tell
the browser which of the files in the archive is the applet
class file to be executed.  The archive attribute
may actually specify a comma-separated list of JAR files.
The Web browser or applet viewer searches these archives for
any files the applet requires.  If a file is not found in an
archive, however, the browser falls back upon its old
behavior and attempts to load the file from the Web server
using a new HTTP request.
