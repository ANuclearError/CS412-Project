20.25 java.awt.event.PaintEvent (JDK 1.1)
An event of this type indicates that a component should have
its update() method invoked.  (The update()
method typically, by default, invokes the
paint() method.)
PaintEvent differs from the other event types in
java.awt.event in that it does not have a
corresponding EventListener interface.
PaintEvent is essentially for internal use by the
AWT redisplay framework, so your programs should not try to
handle it the way they handle other events.  Instead, applets
and custom components should simply override their
paint() and/or update() methods to redraw
themselves appropriately.  AWT automatically invokes
update() (which typically invokes
paint()) when a PaintEvent arrives.
Although you do not typically use the PaintEvent,
redraw events are implemented through this class for
simplicity, so that they are on equal footing with other
event types, and so that advanced programs can manipulate
them through the EventQueue.
public class PaintEvent extends ComponentEvent {
    // Public Constructor
            public PaintEvent(Component source, int id, Rectangle updateRect);
    // Constants
            public static final int PAINT;
            public static final int PAINT_FIRST;
            public static final int PAINT_LAST;
            public static final int UPDATE;
    // Public Instance Methods
            public Rectangle getUpdateRect();
            public String paramString();  // Overrides ComponentEvent
            public void setUpdateRect(Rectangle updateRect);
}
