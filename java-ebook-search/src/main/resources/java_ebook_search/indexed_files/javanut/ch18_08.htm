18.8 java.awt.Canvas (JDK 1.0)
This class is a Component that does no default
drawing or event handling on its own.  You can subclass it
to display any kind of drawing or image, and to handle any
kind of user input event.  Canvas inherits the event
handling methods of its superclass.  In Java 1.1, you can
also subclass Component directly to create a
"lightweight component," instead of having to subclass Canvas.
public class Canvas extends Component {
    // Public Constructor
        1.1 public Canvas();
    // Public Instance Methods
            public void addNotify();  // Overrides Component
            public void paint(Graphics g);  // Overrides Component
}
