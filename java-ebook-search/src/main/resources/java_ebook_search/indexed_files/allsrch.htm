Text Search
The Java applet below provides a search engine for
the entire CD-ROM.  Unlike the searches within an individual book,
this search only finds words in head elements (&lt;H1&gt;, etc.) 
and titles.
The first query with this applet can take a long time
to complete, subsequent queries are much faster.  As the Java runtime
environment in browsers improves, we anticipate that the performance of
this applet will also improve.
