4.2 Comments
Java supports both C-style block comments delimited by
/* and */ and C++-style line
comments indicated by //:
/*  This is a 
        multiline 
            comment.    */ 
 
// This is a single line comment 
// and so // is this 
As in C, block comments can't be nested. Single-line comments are
delimited by the end of a line; extra // indicators
inside a single line have no effect. Line comments are useful for
short comments within methods because you can still wrap block
comments around large chunks of code during development.
By convention, a block comment beginning with
/** indicates a special "doc comment."
A doc comment is commentary that is extracted by automated
documentation generators, such as Sun's
javadoc program that comes with the Java
Development Kit. A doc comment is terminated by the next
*/, just as with a regular block comment. Leading
spacing up to a * on each line is ignored; lines
beginning with @ are interpreted as special tags
for the documentation generator:
/** 
 * I think this class is possibly the most amazing thing you will 
 * ever see. Let me tell you about my own personal vision and
 * motivation in creating it. 
 * &lt;p&gt; 
 * It all began when I was a small child, growing up on the 
 * streets of Idaho. Potatoes were the rage, and life was good... 
 * 
 * @see PotatoPeeler 
 * @see PotatoMasher 
 * @author John 'Spuds' Smith 
 * @version 1.00, 19 Dec 1996

javadoc creates HTML class
documentation by reading the source code and the embedded
comments. The author and version information is presented in the
output and the @see tags make hypertext links to
the appropriate class documentation. The compiler also looks at the
doc comments; in particular, it is interested in the
@deprecated tag, which means that the
method has been declared obsolete and should be avoided in new
programs. The compiler generates a warning message whenever it sees
you use a deprecated feature in your code.
Doc comments can appear above class, method, and variable
definitions, but some tags may not be applicable to all. For example,
a variable declaration can contain only a @see
tag. Table 4.1 summarizes the tags used in doc
comments.
