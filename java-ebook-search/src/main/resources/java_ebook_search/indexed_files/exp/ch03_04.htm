3.4 The Netscape Alternative
If the JDK is not available for your platform, but you have
access to a Java-enabled version of Netscape Navigator, you can take
advantage of a special Netscape switch to compile and run Java
applications. The -java switch provides direct
access to Netscape's implementation of the Java run-time system
and supports the same command-line options as Sun's
java interpreter.  Here's the general syntax for
using the -java switch:
% netscape -java [interpreter options] class name [program arguments]
Before you can use Netscape's -java switch,
you have to download the JDK; you need the
classes.zip file that is part of the
JDK distribution.  After you have unpacked the
distribution, set the CLASSPATH environment
variable to point to both Netscape's class archive and the
classes.zip file from the JDK:
CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/java/classes.zip:/home/vicky/.netscape/moz2_0.zip:.
Now you can compile a .java file using
Netscape's -java switch as follows:
% netscape -java sun.tools.javac.Main source file
In this case, you are actually using the -java
switch to run the Java compiler, javac, and
supplying the source file as an argument to the compiler.
Recall that javac is itself a Java program,
which is why you can run it using the -java
switch.  The above command produces a class file and stores it
in the same directory as the source file.
After you have compiled a Java application with Netscape, you can
use Netscape to run it.  You can use the -java
switch to run nongraphical Java applications.  In other words, you can
run any application that doesn't use AWT.  You
can't use the -java switch to run applications
that use AWT because Netscape has its own toolkit
that employs Netscape native components.  However, you can use the
-java switch to compile applets (and applications)
that use AWT.  As always, you can display these
applets using Netscape as a Web browser.
