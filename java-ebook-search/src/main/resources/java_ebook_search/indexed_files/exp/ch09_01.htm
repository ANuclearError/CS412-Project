Writing a Protocol Handler
The network is the soul of Java. Most of what is new and
exciting about Java centers around the potential for new kinds of
dynamic, networked applications. This chapter discusses the java.net package, which contains classes for communications
and working with networked resources. These classes fall into two
categories: the sockets API and classes for working
with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).  Figure 9.1 shows all of the classes in
java.net.
Figure 9.1: The java.net package
Java's sockets interface provides access to the standard
network protocols used for communications between hosts on the
Internet. Sockets are the mechanism underlying all other kinds of
portable networked communications. Your processes can use sockets to
communicate with a server or peer applications on the Net, but you
have to implement your own application-level protocols for handling
and interpreting the data. Higher-level functionality, like remote
procedure calls and distributed objects, are implemented with sockets.
The Java URL classes provide an
API for accessing well-defined networked resources,
like documents and applications on servers. The classes use an
extensible set of prefabricated protocol and content handlers to
perform the necessary communication and data conversion for accessing
URL resources. With URLs, an
application can fetch a complete file or database record from a server
on the network with just a few lines of code. Applications like Web
browsers, which deal with networked content, use the
URL class to simplify the task
of network programming. They also take advantage of the dynamic
nature of Java, which allows handlers for new types of
URLs to be added on the fly. As new types of
servers and new formats for content evolve, additional
URL handlers can be supplied to retrieve and
interpret the data without modifying the original application.
In this chapter, I'll try to provide some practical and
realistic examples of Java network programming using both
APIs. Sadly, the current state of affairs is 
disappointing. The real release of HotJava isn't
available, and Netscape Navigator imposes many restrictions on what
you can do. In addition, a few standards that we need haven't
been defined. Nevertheless, you can use all of Java's networking
capabilities to build your own free-standing applications. I'll
point out the shortcomings with Netscape Navigator and the standards
scene as I go along.
9.1 Sockets
Sockets are a low-level programming interface for networked
communications. They send streams of data between applications that
may or may not be on the same host. Sockets originated in
BSD UNIX and are, in other
languages, hairy and complicated things with lots of small parts that
can break off and choke little children. The reason for this is that
most socket APIs can be used with almost any kind
of underlying network protocol. Since the protocols that transport
data across the network can have radically different features, the
socket interface can be quite complex. (For a discussion of sockets in
general, see UNIX
Network Programming, by Richard Stevens [Prentice-Hall].)
Java supports a simplified object-oriented interface to sockets
that makes network communications considerably easier. If you have
done network programming using sockets in C or another structured
language, you should be pleasantly surprised at how simple things can
be when objects encapsulate the gory details. If
this is the first time you've come across sockets, you'll
find that talking to another application can be as simple as
reading a file or getting user input. Most forms of I/O in Java,
including network I/O, use the stream classes described in Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities. Streams provide a unified I/O interface; reading
or writing across the Internet is similar to reading or writing a file
on the local system.
Java provides different kinds of sockets to support two
distinct classes of underlying protocols. In this first section,
we'll look at Java's Socket class,
which uses a connection-oriented protocol. A
connection-oriented protocol gives you the equivalent of a telephone
conversation; after establishing a connection, two applications can
send data back and forth; the connection stays in place even when no
one is talking. The protocol ensures that no data is lost and that it
always arrives in order. In the next section we'll look at the
DatagramSocket class, which uses a
connectionless protocol. A connectionless
protocol is more like the postal service. Applications can send short
messages to each other, but no attempt is made to keep the connection
open between messages, to keep the messages in order, or even to
guarantee that they arrive.
In theory, just about any protocol family can be used
underneath the socket layer: Novell's IPX,
Apple's AppleTalk, even the old ChaosNet protocols. But this
isn't a theoretical world. In practice, there's only one
protocol family people care about on the Internet, and only one
protocol family Java supports: the Internet protocols,
IP. The Socket class speaks
TCP, and the DatagramSocket class
speaks UDP, both standard Internet protocols.
These protocols are available on any
system that is connected to the Internet.
Clients and Servers
When writing network applications, it's common to talk about
clients and servers. The distinction is increasingly vague, but the
side that initiates the conversation is usually the
client. The side that accepts the request to
talk is usually the server. In
the case where there are two peer applications using sockets to talk,
the distinction is less important, but for simplicity
we'll use the above definition.
For our purposes, the most important difference between a
client and a server is that a client can create a socket to initiate a
conversation with a server application at any time, while a server
must prepare to listen for incoming conversations in advance. The
java.net.Socket class represents a single side of a
socket connection on either the client or server. 
In addition, the
server uses the java.net.ServerSocket class to wait
for connections from clients. An application acting as a server
creates a ServerSocket object and waits, blocked in
a call to its accept() method, until a connection
arrives. When it does, the accept() method creates
a Socket object the server uses to
communicate with the client. A server carries on multiple
conversations at once; there is only a single
ServerSocket, but one active
Socket object for each client, as shown in Figure 9.2.
Figure 9.2: Clients and servers, Sockets and ServerSockets
A client needs two pieces of information to locate and connect
to another server on the Internet: a hostname (used to find the
host's network address) and a port number. The port number is an
identifier that differentiates between multiple clients or servers on
the same host. A server application listens on a prearranged port
while waiting for connections. Clients select the port number assigned
to the service they want to access. If you think of the host computers
as hotels and the applications as guests, then the ports are like the
guests' room numbers. For one guest to call another, he or she
must know the other party's hotel name and room number.
Clients
A client application opens a connection to a server by constructing a
Socket that specifies the hostname and port number
of the desired server:
try { 
    Socket sock = new Socket("wupost.wustl.edu", 25); 
}  
catch ( UnknownHostException e ) { 
    System.out.println("Can't find host."); 
}  
catch ( IOException e ) { 
    System.out.println("Error connecting to host."); 
} 
This code fragment attempts to connect a Socket to
port 25 (the SMTP mail service) of the host
wupost.wustl.edu. The client handles the
possibility that the hostname can't be resolved
(UnknownHostException) and that it might not be
able to connect to it (IOException).
As an alternative to using a hostname, you can provide a string version 
of the host's IP address: 
Socket sock = new Socket("128.252.120.1", 25);    // wupost.wustl.edu 
Once a connection is made, input and output streams can be retrieved with 
the Socket getInputStream() 
and getOutputStream() methods. The following 
(rather arbitrary and strange) conversation illustrates sending and receiving 
some data with the streams. Refer to Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities for a complete 
discussion of working with streams. 
try { 
    Socket server = new Socket("foo.bar.com", 1234); 
    InputStream in = server.getInputStream(); 
    OutputStream out = server.getOutputStream(); 
 
    // Write a byte 
    out.write(42); 
 
    // Say "Hello" (send newline delimited string) 
    PrintStream pout = new PrintStream( out ); 
    pout.println("Hello!"); 
 
    // Read a byte 
    Byte back = in.read(); 
 
    // Read a newline delimited string 
    DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream( in ); 
    String response = din.readLine(); 
 
    server.close(); 
}  
catch (IOException e ) { } 
In the exchange above, the client first creates a
Socket for communicating with the server. The
Socket constructor specifies the server's
hostname (foo.bar.com) and a prearranged port
number (1234). Once the connection is established, the client writes a
single byte to the server using the
OutputStream's write()
method. It then wraps a PrintStream around the
OutputStream in order to send text more
easily. Next, it performs the complementary operations, reading a byte
from the server using InputStream's
read() and then creating a
DataInputStream from which to get a string of
text. Finally, it terminates the connection with the
close() method. All these operations have the
potential to generate IOExceptions; the
catch clause is where our application would deal
with these.
Servers
After a connection is established, a server application uses the same
kind of Socket object for its side of the
communications. However, to accept a connection from a client, it
must first create a ServerSocket, bound to the
correct port. Let's recreate the previous conversation from the
server's point of view:
// Meanwhile, on foo.bar.com... 
try { 
    ServerSocket listener = new ServerSocket( 1234 ); 
 
    while ( !finished ) { 
        Socket aClient = listener.accept();    // wait for connection 
 
        InputStream in = aClient.getInputStream(); 
        OutputStream out = aClient.getOutputStream(); 
 
        // Read a byte 
        Byte importantByte = in.read(); 
 
        // Read a string 
        DataInputStream din = new DataInputStream( in ); 
        String request = din.readLine(); 
 
        // Write a byte 
        out.write(43); 
 
        // Say "Goodbye" 
        PrintStream pout = new PrintStream( out ); 
        pout.println("Goodbye!"); 
 
        aClient.close(); 
    } 
 
    listener.close(); 
 
} 
catch (IOException e ) { } 
First, our server creates a ServerSocket attached
to port 1234. On some systems there are rules about what ports an
application can use. Port numbers below 1024 are usually reserved for
system processes and standard, well-known services, so we pick a port
number outside of this range. The ServerSocket need
be created only once. Thereafter we can accept as many connections as
arrive.
Next we enter a loop, waiting for the
accept() method of the
ServerSocket to return an active
Socket connection from a client. When a connection
has been established, we perform the server side of our dialog, then
close the connection and return to the top of the loop to wait for
another connection. Finally, when the server application wants to
stop listening for connections altogether, it calls the
close() method of the
ServerSocket.[1]
[1] 
A somewhat obscure security feature in TCP/IP
specifies that if a server socket actively closes a connection while a
client is connected, it may not be able to bind (attach itself) to the
same port on the server host again for a period of time (the maximum
time to live of a packet on the network). It's possible to turn off
this feature, and it's likely that your Java implementation will have
done so.
As you can see, this server is single-threaded; it handles
one connection at a time; it doesn't call
accept() to listen for a new connection until it's
finished with the current connection. A more realistic server would
have a loop that accepts connections concurrently and passes them off
to their own threads for processing. (Our tiny HTTP
daemon in a later section will do just this.)
Sockets and security
The examples above presuppose the client has permission to
connect to the server, and that the server is allowed to listen on the
specified socket. This is not always the case. Specifically, applets
and other applications run under the auspices of a
SecurityManager that can impose arbitrary
restrictions on what hosts they may or may not talk to, and whether
they can listen for connections. The security policy imposed by the
current version of Netscape Navigator allows applets to open
socket connections only to the host that served them. That is, they can
talk back only to the server from which their class files were
retrieved. Applets are not allowed to open server sockets themselves.
Now, this doesn't meant an applet can't cooperate
with its server to communicate with anyone, anywhere. A server could
run a proxy that lets the applet communicate indirectly with anyone it
likes. What the current security policy prevents is malicious applets
roaming around inside corporate firewalls. It places the burden of
security on the originating server, and not the client
machine. Restricting access to the originating server limits the
usefulness of "trojan" applications that do annoying
things from the client side. You won't let your proxy mail bomb
people, because you'll be blamed.
The DateAtHost Client
Many networked workstations run a time service that dispenses their
local clock time on a well-known port. This was a precursor of
NTP, the more general Network Time Protocol. In the
next example, DateAtHost, we'll make a specialized
subclass of java.util.Date that fetches the time
from a remote host instead of initializing itself from the local
clock. (See Chapter 7, Basic Utility Classes for a complete discussion of the
Date class.)
DateAtHost connects to the time service
(port 37) and reads four bytes representing the time on the remote
host. These four bytes are interpreted as an integer representing the
number of seconds since the turn of the
century. DateAtHost converts this to Java's
variant of the absolute time (milliseconds since January 1, 1970, a date
that should be familiar to UNIX users) and then
uses the remote host's time to initialize itself:
import java.net.Socket; 
import java.io.*; 
  
public class DateAtHost extends java.util.Date { 
    static int timePort = 37;            
    static final long offset = 2208988800L; // Seconds from century to  
                                            // Jan 1, 1970 00:00 GMT 
  
    public DateAtHost( String host ) throws IOException { 
        this( host, timePort ); 
    } 
 
    public DateAtHost( String host, int port ) throws IOException { 
        Socket sock = new Socket( host, port ); 
        DataInputStream din = 
            new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream()); 
        int time = din.readInt(); 
        sock.close(); 
  
        setTime( (((1L &lt;&lt; 32) + time) - offset) * 1000 ); 
    } } 
That's all there is to it. It's not very long, even with a
few frills. We have supplied two possible constructors for
DateAtHost. Normally we'll use the first,
which simply takes the name of the remote host as an argument. The
second, overloaded constructor specifies the hostname and the
port number of the remote time service. (If the time service were
running on a nonstandard port, we would use the second constructor to
specify the alternate port number.) This second constructor does the
work of making the connection and setting the time. The first
constructor simply invokes the second (using the
this() construct) with the default port as an
argument. Supplying simplified constructors that invoke their siblings
with default arguments is a common and useful technique.
The second constructor opens a socket to the specified port on the
remote host. It creates a DataInputStream to wrap
the input stream and then reads a 4-byte integer using the
readInt() method. It's no coincidence the bytes are
in the right order. 
Java's DataInputStream
and DataOutputStream classes work with the bytes of
integer types in network byte order (most
significant to least significant). The time protocol (and other
standard network protocols that deal with binary data) also uses the
network byte order, so we don't need to call any conversion
routines. (Explicit data conversions would probably be necessary if we
were using a nonstandard protocol, especially when talking to a
non-Java client or server.) After reading the data, we're
finished with the socket, so we close it, terminating the connection
to the server. Finally, the constructor initializes the rest of the
object by calling Date's
setTime() method with the calculated time
value.[2]
[2] 
The conversion first creates a long value, which is the unsigned 
equivalent of the integer time. It subtracts 
an offset to make the time relative to the epoch (January 1, 1970) rather 
than the century, and multiples by 1000 to convert to milliseconds. 
The DateAtHost class can work with a time
retrieved from a remote host almost as easily as
Date is used with the time on the local host. The
only additional overhead is that we have to deal with the possible
IOException that can be thrown by the
DateAtHost constructor:
try { 
    Date d = new DateAtHost( "sura.net" ); 
    System.out.println( "The time over there is: " + d ); 
    int hours = d.getHours(); 
    int minutes = d.getMinutes(); 
    ... 
}  
catch ( IOException e ) { } 
This example fetches the time at the host sura.net 
and prints its value. It then looks at some components of the time using 
the getHours() and getMinutes() 
methods of the Date class.
The TinyHttpd Server
Have you ever wanted your very own Web server? Well, you're in
luck. In this section, we're going to build
TinyHttpd, a minimal but functional
HTTP daemon. TinyHttpd listens
on a specified port and services simple HTTP
"get file" requests. They look something like this:
GET /path/filename [optional stuff] 
Your Web browser sends one or more as lines for each document
it retrieves. Upon reading the request, the server tries to open
the specified file and send its contents. If that document contains
references to images or other items to be displayed inline,
the browser continues with additional GET
requests. For best performance (especially in a time-slicing
environment), TinyHttpd services each request in
its own thread. 
Therefore, TinyHttpd can service
several requests concurrently.
Over and above the limitations imposed by its simplicity,
TinyHttpd suffers from the limitations imposed by
the fickleness of filesystem access, as discussed in Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities. It's important to remember that file pathnames
are still architecture dependent--as is the concept of a
filesystem to begin with. This example should work, as is, on
UNIX and DOS-like systems, but
may require some customizations to account for differences on other
platforms. It's possible to write more elaborate code that uses the
environmental information provided by Java to tailor itself to the
local system. (Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities gives some hints about how to
do this).
WARNING:
This example will serve files from your host without
protection. Don't try this at work.
Now, without further ado, here's TinyHttpd: 
import java.net.*; 
import java.io.*; 
import java.util.*; 
 
public class TinyHttpd {  
    public static void main( String argv[] ) throws IOException { 
        ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(Integer.parseInt(argv[0])); 
        while ( true ) 
            new TinyHttpdConnection( ss.accept() ); 
    } 
} 
 
class TinyHttpdConnection extends Thread { 
    Socket sock; 
    TinyHttpdConnection ( Socket s ) { 
        sock = s; 
        setPriority( NORM_PRIORITY - 1 ); 
        start(); 
    } 
 
    public void run() { 
        try { 
            OutputStream out = sock.getOutputStream(); 
            String req = 
                new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream()).readLine(); 
            System.out.println( "Request: "+req ); 
 
            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer( req ); 
            if ( (st.countTokens() &gt;= 2) &amp;&amp; 
                  st.nextToken().equals("GET") ) { 
                if ( (req = st.nextToken()).startsWith("/") ) 
                    req = req.substring( 1 ); 
                if ( req.endsWith("/") || req.equals("") )
                    req = req + "index.html";
 
                try {    
                    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream ( req ); 
                    byte [] data = new byte [ fis.available() ]; 
                    fis.read( data ); 
                    out.write( data ); 
                }  
                catch ( FileNotFoundException e ) 
                    new PrintStream( out ).println("404 Not Found"); 
            } else  
                new PrintStream( out ).println( "400 Bad Request" ); 
 
            sock.close(); 
        }  
        catch ( IOException e ) 
            System.out.println( "I/O error " + e ); 
    } 
} 
Compile TinyHttpd and place it in your class 
path. Go to a directory with some interesting documents and start the daemon, 
specifying an unused port number as an argument. For example: 
% java TinyHttpd 1234
You should now be able to use your Web browser to
retrieve files from your host. You'll have to specify the
nonstandard port number in the URL. For example, if
your hostname is foo.bar.com, and you started the
server as above, you could reference a file as in:
http://foo.bar.com:1234/welcome.html 
TinyHttpd looks for files relative to its current
directory, so the pathnames you provide should be relative to
that location. Retrieved some files? Al'righty then,
let's take a closer look.
TinyHttpd is comprised of two classes. The
public TinyHttpd class contains the
main() method of our standalone application. It
begins by creating a ServerSocket, attached to the
specified port. It then loops, waiting for client connections and
creating instances of the second class, a
TinyHttpdConnection thread, to service each
request. The while loop waits for the
ServerSocket accept() method to
return a new Socket for each client connection. The
Socket is passed as an argument to construct the
TinyHttpdConnection thread that handles it.
TinyHttpdConnection is a subclass of
Thread. It lives long enough to process one client
connection and then dies.
TinyHttpdConnection's constructor does three
things. After saving the Socket argument for its
caller, it adjusts its own priority and then invokes
start() to bring its run()
method to life. By lowering its priority to
NORM_PRIORITY-1 (just below the default priority),
we ensure that the threads servicing established connections
won't block TinyHttpd's main thread
from accepting new requests. (On a time-slicing system, this is less
important.)
The body of TinyHttpdConnection's
run() method is where all the magic
happens. First, we fetch an OutputStream for talking
back to our client. The second line reads the GET
request from the InputStream into the variable
req. This request is a single newline-terminated
String that looks like the GET
request we described earlier. Since this is the only time we read from
this socket, it's hard to resist the urge to be terse. Alternatively,
we could break that statement into three steps: getting the
InputStream, creating the
DataInputStream wrapper, and reading the line. The
three-line version is certainly more readable and should not be
noticeably slower.
We then parse the contents of req to extract
a filename. The next few lines are a brief exercise in string
manipulation. We create a StringTokenizer and make
sure there are at least two tokens. Using
nextToken(), we take the first token and make sure
it's the word GET. (If both conditions
aren't met, we have an error.) Then we take the next token
(which should be a filename), assign it to req, and
check whether it begins with "/". If so, we use
substring() to strip the first character, giving us
a filename relative to the current directory. If it doesn't
begin with "/", the filename is already relative to the
current directory. Finally, we check to see if the requested filename
looks like a directory name (i.e., ends in slash) or is empty. In
these cases, we append the familiar default filename
index.html.
Once we have the filename, we try to open the specified file
and load its contents into a large byte array. (We did something
similar in the ListIt example in Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities.) If all goes well, we write the data out to
client on the OutputStream. If we can't parse the
request or the file doesn't exist, we wrap our
OutputStream with a PrintStream
to make it easier to send a textual message. Then we return an
appropriate HTTP error message. Finally, we close
the socket and return from run(), removing our
Thread.
Taming the daemon
The biggest problem with TinyHttpd is that there
are no restrictions on the files it can access. With a little
trickery, the daemon will happily send any file in your filesystem to
the client. It would be nice if we could restrict
TinyHttpd to files that are in the current
directory, or a subdirectory. To make the daemon safer, let's
add a security manager. I discussed the general framework for security
managers in Chapter 7, Basic Utility Classes. Normally, a security manager is
used to prevent Java code downloaded over the Net from doing anything
suspicious. However, a security manager will serve nicely to restrict
file access in a self-contained application.
Here's the code for the security manager class: 
import java.io.*; 
 
class TinyHttpdSecurityManager extends SecurityManager {  
 
    public void checkAccess(Thread g) { }; 
    public void checkListen(int port) { }; 
    public void checkLink(String lib) { }; 
    public void checkPropertyAccess(String key) { }; 
    public void checkAccept(String host, int port) { }; 
    public void checkWrite(FileDescriptor fd) { }; 
    public void checkRead(FileDescriptor fd) { }; 
 
    public void checkRead( String s ) {  
        if ( new File(s).isAbsolute() || (s.indexOf("..") != -1) ) 
            throw new 
               SecurityException("Access to file : "+s+" denied."); 
    }  
}  
 The
heart of this security manager is the checkRead()
method. It checks two things: it makes sure that the pathname
we've been given isn't an absolute path, which could name any
file in the filesystem; and it makes sure the pathname doesn't
have a double dot (..) in it, which refers to the
parent of the current directory. With these two restrictions, we can
be sure (at least on a UNIX or
DOS-like filesystem) that we have restricted access
to only subdirectories of the current directory. If the pathname is
absolute or contains "..",
checkRead() throws a
SecurityException.
The other do-nothing method implementations--e.g.,
checkAccess()--allow the daemon to do its work
without interference from the security manager. If we don't
install a security manager, the application runs with no
restrictions. However, as soon as we install any security manager, we
inherit implementations of many "check" routines. The
default implementations won't let you do anything; they just
throw a security exception as soon as they are called. We have to open
holes so the daemon can do its own work; it still has to accept
connections, listen on sockets, create threads, read property lists,
etc. Therefore, we override the default checks with routines that
allow these things.
Now you're thinking, isn't that overly permissive? Not for 
this application; after all, TinyHttpd never 
tries to load foreign classes from the Net. The only code we are executing 
is our own, and it's assumed we won't do anything dangerous. If 
we were planning to execute untrusted code, the security manager would 
have to be more careful about what to permit. 
Now that we have a security manager, we must modify
TinyHttpd to use it. Two changes are necessary: we
must install the security manager and catch the security exceptions it
generates. To install the security manager, add the following code at
the beginning of TinyHttpd's
main() method:
System.setSecurityManager( new TinyHttpdSecurityManager() ); 
To catch the security exception, add the following
catch clause after
FileNotFoundException's catch
clause:
catch ( SecurityException e ) 
    new PrintStream( out ).println( "403 Forbidden" ); 
Now the daemon can't access anything that isn't within the
current directory or a subdirectory. If it tries to, the security
manager throws an exception and prevents access to the file. The
daemon then returns a standard HTTP error message
to the client.
TinyHttpd still has room for
improvement. First, it consumes a lot of memory by allocating a huge
array to read the entire contents of the file all at once. A more
realistic implementation would use a buffer and send large amounts of
data in several passes. TinyHttpd also fails to
deal with simple things like directories. It wouldn't be hard to
add a few lines of code (again, refer to the ListIt
example in Chapter 8, Input/Output Facilities) to read a directory and generate
linked HTML listings like most Web servers do.
