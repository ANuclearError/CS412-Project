1.7 The java.math Package
The java.math package is new in Java 1.1.
It contains two classes that support arithmetic on arbitrarily large
integers and floating-point numbers: BigInteger
and BigDecimal. The BigInteger
class also defines some methods for handling modular arithmetic
and determining primality that are needed for cryptographic purposes.
See Chapter 14, The java.math Package, for complete reference material on the two 
classes in this package.
