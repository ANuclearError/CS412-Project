1.8 The java.util.zip Package
The java.util.zip package is new in Java 1.1.
It contains classes that provide support for general-purpose
data compression and decompression using the ZLIB compression
algorithms. The important classes in
java.util.zip are those that provide the means
to read and write data that is compatible with the popular 
GZIP and ZIP formats: GZIPInputStream,
GZIPOutputStream, ZipInputStream,
and ZipOutputStream.
The GZIP and ZIP classes are easy to use because they
subclass java.io.
FilterInputStream and 
java.io.FilterOutputStream. While
a GZIP file is simply a stream of compressed data, a ZIP
file, or archive, can contain multiple compressed files.
A ZipEntry 
object represents each compressed file in the archive. 
The ZipFile
class is provided as a convenience for reading an archive; it allows
nonsequential access to the entries in a ZIP file while
the ZipInputStream class provides only sequential
access.
The remainder of the classes in java.util.zip 
support the GZIP and ZIP classes. 
The generic Deflater and Inflater 
classes implement the ZLIB algorithms; they are used by 
DeflaterOutputStream and 
InflaterInputStream to 
decompress and compress data. The Checksum 
interface and the classes that implement it, Adler32 
and CRC32, define algorithms that generate 
checksums from stream data. These checksums
are used by the CheckedInputStream and 
CheckedOutputStream classes.
See Chapter 18, The java.util.zip Package, for complete reference material on all of the
classes in the java.util.zip package.
