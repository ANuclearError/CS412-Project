5.4 Hashtables
The Dictionary class is an 
abstract class that defines 
methods for associating key objects with value objects. Given a key, an 
instance of Dictionary is able 
to return its associated value. The Hashtable 
class is a concrete subclass of Dictionary 
that uses a data structure called a hashtable and a technique called chained 
hashing to allow values associated with keys to be fetched with minimal 
searching. You might use a Hashtable 
object to associate weather reports with the names of cities and towns, 
for example. 
Before explaining hashtables or chained hashing, consider the problem 
of finding a key/value pair in an array that contains references 
to key/value pairs in no particular order. The array might look 
something like what is shown in Figure 5.1. 
Figure 5.1: An array of key/value pairs
Since we cannot make any assumptions about where in the array a key is
to be found, the most reasonable search strategy is a linear search
that starts at one end of the array and looks at each array element
until it finds what it is looking for or reaches the other end of the
array. For an array with just a few elements, a linear search is a
reasonable strategy, but for an array with hundreds of elements it is
not. If we know where in the array to look for a key, however, we can
eliminate most of the searching effort. Knowing where to look for a
key is the idea behind a hashtable.
With a hashtable, each key object has a relatively unique integer
value that is called a hashcode.  The
Object class defines a
hashCode() method, so every object in Java has such
a method. The hashcode returned by this method computes an array index
for a key object as follows:
array.length % hashCode()
This array index, or hash index, stores the key/value pair
in a hashtable array. If there is nothing stored at that index, the
key/value pair is placed at that position in the
array. However, if there is already a key/value pair at that hash
index, the Hashtable stores the key/value pair in a
linked list at that position in the array. This strategy for managing
multiple keys with the same hash index is called chained hashing. The
array for hashtable that uses this strategy might look like Figure 5.2.
Figure 5.2: An array of key/value pairs that uses chained hashing
Now, when we want to fetch a key/value pair, all we have to do is 
recalculate the hash index for the key object and look at that position 
in the hashtable array. If the key stored at that hash index is the right 
key, then we have found what we are looking for by examining only one array 
element instead of searching. However, if the key is not the right key, 
all we have to do is search the items in the linked list at that position 
to find our key/value pair. 
You can create a Hashtable 
object using the constructor that takes no arguments: 
Hashtable h = new Hashtable()
This constructor creates an empty Hashtable.  There
are other constructors that take parameters to allow you to tune the
performance of a Hashtable object. The first
parameter you can specify is the capacity of the hash table, which is
the length of the array used to implement it. The longer the array,
the less likely it is that multiple keys will share the same hash
index. The default array length is 101. To create a
Hashtable object with an array length of 1009,
use the following constructor:
Hashtable h = new Hashtable(1009);
The number that you choose for the array length should be a prime number. 
If it is not, the key/value pairs stored in the array will tend 
to be less evenly distributed. 
The load factor of a hashtable is the ratio of the number of key/value 
pairs in the hashtable to the array length. A load factor of 0 means that 
the Hashtable is empty. As 
the load factor increases, so does the likelihood that multiple key/value 
pairs will share the same hash index. When the load factor becomes greater 
than 1, it means that the number of key/value pairs in a hashtable 
is greater than the array length, so that at least one hash index is being 
shared by multiple key/value pairs. Clearly, a low load factor is 
better than a high load factor in terms of performance. You can specify 
the maximum permissible load factor for a Hashtable 
object when you create it. For example: 
Hashtable h = new Hashtable(1009, .62);
If not specified, the maximum load factor for a Hashtable 
object is .75. When a key/value pair is added to a Hashtable 
that would otherwise cause the load factor to exceed the maximum value, 
the Hashtable performs a rehash. 
This means that the Hashtable 
creates a new array with a length one greater than double the length of 
the old array. It then recomputes the hash index for each key/value 
pair in the old array and stores each key/value pair in the new 
array at the new hash index. Obviously, this is an undesirable performance 
hit, so if you know approximately how many items you will add to a Hashtable, 
you should create one with an appropriate initial capacity. 
After you have created a Hashtable 
object, you can add new key/value pairs to it, or modify the value 
in an existing key/value pair, by calling the put() 
method. The put() method takes 
two arguments: a reference to a key object and a reference to a value object. 
It first looks for a key/value pair in the hashtable with the key 
equal to the specified key. If there is such a key/value pair, the 
put() method replaces the previous 
value with the specified value and returns a reference to the previous 
value object. If, however, there is no such key/value pair, the 
put() method creates a new 
key/value pair, adds it to the hashtable and returns null. 
Here is a fragment of a class that uses a Hashtable 
to store weather forecasts. 
import java.util.Hashtable;
class WeatherForecastDictionary {
    private Hashtable ht = new Hashtable(13291);
    public void putForecast(String locale, WeatherForecast forecast) {
        ht.put(locale, forecast);
    }
...
The get() method returns the 
value associated with a given key in a Hashtable 
object. It takes one argument that is a reference to the key it should 
search for. If the get() method 
does not find a key/value pair with a key equal to the specified 
key, it returns null. Here 
is a method that uses the get() 
method to retrieve a weather forecast: 
public WeatherForecast getForecast(String locale) {
    return (WeatherForecast)ht.get(locale);
}
The various equality tests done by a Hashtable 
use a given key object's equals() 
method. Because of the way that an object's hashCode() 
and equals() methods are used 
by the Hashtable class, it 
is important that if you override the definition of either of these methods, 
you do so in a consistent way. In other words, if two objects are considered 
equal by the equals() method 
for the class, then the hashCode() 
method for each object must return the same hashcode value. If that is 
not the case, when those objects are used as keys in a Hashtable 
object, the Hashtable will 
produce inconsistent results. 
Once you have added key/value pairs to a Hashtable, 
you can use the keys() and 
elements() methods to get Enumeration 
objects that iterate through the key and value objects, respectively. The 
containsKey() method allows 
you to search the Hashtable 
for a particular key object, while contains() 
searches for a particular value object. The Hashtable 
class also defines a remove() 
method for removing key/value pairs from a Hashtable.
