Description
The Thread class encapsulates all of the
information about a single thread of control running in a Java environment.
Thread objects are used to control threads in
a multithreaded program.
The execution of Java code is always under the control of
a Thread object. The Thread
class provides a static method called currentThread()
that can be used to get a reference to the Thread
object that controls the current thread of execution.
In order for a Thread object to be useful,
it must be associated with a method that it is supposed to run.
Java provides two ways of associating a Thread
object with a method:
Declare a subclass of Thread
that defines a run() method. When such a class
is instantiated and the object's start() method
is called, the thread invokes this run() method.
Pass a reference to an object that implements the
Runnable interface to a Thread constructor.
When the start() method of such a
Thread object is called, the thread
invokes the run()
method of the Runnable object.
After a thread is started, it dies when one of the following
things happens:
The run()
method called by the Thread returns.
An exception is thrown that causes the run()
method to be exited.
The stop() method of the
Thread is called.

Constants
MAX_PRIORITY
public final static int MAX_PRIORITY = 10
Description
The highest priority a thread can have.
MIN_PRIORITY
public final static int MIN_PRIORITY = 1
Description
The lowest priority a thread can have.
NORM_PRIORITY
public final static int NORM_PRIORITY = 5
Description
The default priority assigned to a thread.
Constructors
Thread
public Thread()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a Thread object that belongs to
the same ThreadGroup object as the current thread,
has the same daemon attribute as the current thread, has the same
priority as the current thread, and has a default name.
A Thread object created with this constructor
invokes its own run() method when the Thread
object's start() method is called. This is not
useful unless the object belongs to a subclass of the Thread
class that overrides the run() method.
Calling this constructor is equivalent to:
Thread(null, null, genName)
genName is an automatically generated name
of the form "Thread-"+n, where n
is an integer incremented each time a Thread
object is created.
public Thread(String name)
Parameters
name
The name of this Thread object.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a Thread object that belongs to
the same ThreadGroup object as the current thread,
has the same daemon attribute as the current thread, has the same
priority as the current thread, and has the specified name.
A Thread object created with this constructor
invokes its own run() method when the Thread
object's start() method is called. This is not
useful unless the object belongs to a subclass of the Thread
class that overrides the run() method.
Calling this constructor is equivalent to:
Thread(null, null, name)
The uniqueness of the specified Thread
object's name is not checked, which may be a problem for programs
that attempt to identify Thread objects by their
name.
public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target)
Parameters
group
The ThreadGroup object that this
Thread object is to be added to.
target
A reference to an object that implements the Runnable
interface.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a Thread object that belongs to
the specified ThreadGroup object, has the same
daemon attribute as the current thread, has the same priority as
the current thread, and has a default name.
A Thread object created with this constructor
invokes the run() method of the specified Runnable
object when the Thread object's start()
method is called.
Calling this constructor is equivalent to:
Thread(group, target, genName)
genName is an automatically generated name
of the form "Thread-"+n, where n
is an integer that is incremented each time a Thread
object is created.
public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name)
Parameters
group
The ThreadGroup object that this
Thread object is to be added to.
target
A reference to an object that implements the Runnable
interface.
name
The name of this Thread object.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a Thread object that belongs to
the specified ThreadGroup object, has the same
daemon attribute as the current thread, has the same priority as
the current thread, and has the specified name.
A Thread object created with this constructor
invokes the run() method of the specified Runnable
object when the Thread object's start()
method is called.
The uniqueness of the specified Thread
object's name is not checked, which may be a problem for programs
that attempt to identify Thread objects by their
names.
public Thread(ThreadGroup group, String name)
Parameters
group
The ThreadGroup object that this
Thread object is to be added to.
name
The name of this Thread object.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a Thread object that belongs to
the specified ThreadGroup object, has the same
daemon attribute as the current thread, has the same priority as
the current thread, and has the specified name.
A Thread object created with this constructor
invokes its own run() method when the Thread
object's start() method is called. This is not
useful unless the object belongs to a subclass of the Thread
class that overrides the run() method.
Calling this constructor is equivalent to:
Thread(group, null, name)
The uniqueness of the specified Thread
object's name is not checked, which may be a problem for programs
that attempt to identify Thread objects by their
name.
Class Methods
activeCount
public static int activeCount()
Returns
The current number of threads in the ThreadGroup
of the currently running thread.
Description
This method returns the number of threads in the ThreadGroup
of the currently running thread for which the isAlive()
method returns true.
currentThread
public static native Thread currentThread()
Returns
A reference to the Thread object that controls
the currently executing thread.
Description
This method returns a reference to the Thread
object that controls the currently executing thread.
dumpStack
public static void dumpStack()
Description
This method outputs a stack trace of the currently running
thread.
enumerate
public static int enumerate(Thread tarray[])
Parameters
tarray
A reference to an array of Thread
objects.
Returns
The number of Thread objects stored in
the array.
Description
This method stores a reference in the array for each of the
Thread objects in the ThreadGroup
of the currently running thread for which the isAlive()
method returns true.
Calling this method is equivalent to:
currentThread().getThreadGroup().enumerate(tarray)
If the array is not big enough to contain references to all
the Thread objects, only as many references as
will fit are put into the array. No indication is given that some
Thread objects were left out, so it is a good
idea to call activeCount() before calling this
method, to get an idea of how large to make the array.
interrupted
public static boolean interrupted()
Returns
true if the currently running thread has
been interrupted; otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not the currently running
thread has been interrupted.
sleep
public static native void sleep(long millis)
Parameters
millis
The number of milliseconds that the currently running
thread should sleep.
Throws
InterruptedException
If another thread interrupts the currently running
thread.
Description
This method causes the currently running thread to sleep.
The method does not return until at least the specified number of
milliseconds have elapsed.
While a thread is sleeping, it retains ownership of all locks.
The Object class defines a method called wait()
that is similar to sleep() but causes the currently
running thread to temporarily relinquish its locks.
public static void sleep(long millis, int nanos)
Parameters
millis
The number of milliseconds that the currently running
thread should sleep.
nanos
An additional number of nanoseconds to sleep.
Throws
InterruptedException
If another thread interrupts the currently running
thread.
Description
This method causes the currently running thread to sleep.
The method does not return until at least the specified number of
milliseconds have elapsed.
While a thread is sleeping, it retains ownership of all locks.
The Object class defines a method called wait()
that is similar to sleep() but causes the currently
running thread to temporarily relinquish its locks.
Note that Sun's reference implementation
of Java does not attempt to implement the precision implied by this
method. Instead, it rounds to the nearest millisecond (unless millis
is 0, in 
which case it rounds up to 1 millisecond)
and calls sleep(long).
yield
public static native void yield()
Description
This method causes the currently running thread to yield control
of the processor so that another thread can be scheduled.
Instance Methods
checkAccess
public void checkAccess()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method determines if the currently running thread has
permission to modify this Thread object.
countStackFrames
public native int countStackFrames()
Returns
The number of pending method invocations on this thread's
stack.
Description
This method returns the number of pending method invocations
on this thread's stack.
destroy
public void destroy()
Description
This method is meant to terminate this thread without any
of the usual cleanup (i.e., any locks held by the thread are not
released). This method provides a last-resort way to terminate
a thread. While a thread can defeat its stop()
method by catching objects thrown from it, there is nothing that
a thread can do to stop itself from being destroyed.
Note that Sun's reference implementation
of Java does not implement the documented functionality of this
method. Instead, the implementation of this method just throws a
NoSuchMethodError.
getName
public final String getName()
Returns
The name of this thread.
Description
This method returns the name of this Thread
object.
getPriority
public final int getPriority()
Returns
The priority of this thread.
Description
This method returns the priority of this Thread
object.
getThreadGroup
public final ThreadGroup getThreadGroup()
Returns
The ThreadGroup of this thread.
Description
This method returns a reference to the ThreadGroup
that this Thread object belongs to.
interrupt
public void interrupt()
Description
This method interrupts this Thread object.
Note that prior to version 1.1, Sun's reference implementation
of Java does not implement the documented functionality of this method.
Instead, the method just sets a private flag
that indicates that an interrupt has been requested. None of the
methods that should throw an InterruptedException
currently do. However, the interrupted() and
isInterrupted() methods do return true
after this method has been called.
isAlive
public final native boolean isAlive()
Returns
true if this thread is alive; otherwise
false.
Description
This method determines whether or not this Thread
object is alive. A Thread object is alive if
it has been started and has not yet died. In other words, it has
been scheduled to run before and can still be scheduled to run again.
A thread is generally alive after its start() method
is called and until its stop() method is called.
isDaemon
public final boolean isDaemon()
Returns
true if the thread is a daemon thread;
otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not this thread is a daemon
thread, based on the value of the daemon
attribute of this Thread object.
isInterrupted
public boolean isInterrupted()
Returns
true if this thread has been interrupted;
otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not this Thread
object has been interrupted.
join
public final void join()
Throws
InterruptedException
If another thread interrupts this thread.
Description
This method allows the thread that calls it to wait for the
Thread associated with this method to die. The
method returns when the Thread dies. If this thread
is already dead, then this method returns immediately.
public final synchronized void join(long millis)
Parameters
millis
The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for this
thread to die.
Throws
InterruptedException
If another thread interrupts this thread.
Description
This method causes a thread to wait to die. The method returns
when this Thread object dies or after the specified
number of milliseconds has elapsed, whichever comes first. However,
if the specified number of milliseconds is zero, the method will
wait forever for this thread to die. If this thread is already dead,
the method returns immediately.
public final synchronized void join(long millis, int nanos)
Parameters
millis
The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for this
thread to die.
nanos
An additional number of nanoseconds to wait.
Throws
InterruptedException
If another thread interrupts this thread.
Description
This method causes a thread to wait to die. The method returns
when this Thread object dies or after the specified
amount of time has elapsed, whichever comes first. However, if millis
and nanos are zero, the method will wait forever
for this thread to die. If this thread is already dead, the method
returns immediately.
Note that Sun's reference implementation
of Java does not attempt to implement the precision implied by this
method. Instead, it rounds to the nearest millisecond (unless millis
is 0, in which case it rounds up to 1 millisecond)
and calls join(long).
resume
public final void resume()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method resumes a suspended thread. The method causes
this Thread object to once again be eligible
to be run. Calling this method for a thread that is not suspended
has no effect.
run
public void run()
Implements
Runnable.run()
Description
A Thread object's start()
method causes the thread to invoke a run() method.
If this Thread object was created without a specified
Runnable object, the Thread object's
own run() method is executed. This behavior is
only useful in a subclass of Thread that overrides
this run() method, since the run()
method of the Thread class does not do anything.
setDaemon
public final void setDaemon(boolean on)
Parameters
on
The new value for this thread's daemon attribute.
Throws
IllegalThreadStateException
If this method is called after this thread has been
started and while it is still alive.
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method sets the daemon attribute
of this Thread object to the given value. This
method must be called before the thread is started. If a thread
dies and there are no other threads except daemon threads alive,
the Java virtual machine stops.
setName
public final void setName(String name)
Parameters
name
The new name for this thread.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method sets the name of this Thread
object to the given value. The uniqueness of the specified Thread
object's name is not checked, which may be a problem for programs
that attempt to identify Thread objects by their
name.
setPriority
public final void setPriority(int newPriority)
Parameters
newPriority
The new priority for this thread.
Throws
IllegalArgumentException
If the given priority is less than MIN_PRIORITY
or greater than MAX_PRIORITY.
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method sets the priority
of this Thread to the given value.
start
public synchronized native void start()
Throws
IllegalThreadStateException
If this Thread object's start()
method has been called before.
Description
This method starts this Thread object,
allowing it to be scheduled for execution. The top-level code that
is executed by the thread is the run() method
of the Runnable object specified in the constructor
that was used to create this object. If no such object was specified,
the top-level code executed by the thread is this object's run()
method.
It is not permitted to start a thread more than once.
stop
public final void stop()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method causes this Thread object to
stop executing by throwing a ThreadDeath object.
The object is thrown in this thread, even if the method is called
from a different thread. This thread is forced to stop whatever
it is doing and throw a newly created ThreadDeath
object. If this thread was suspended, it is resumed; if it was sleeping,
it is awakened.
Normally, you should not catch ThreadDeath
objects in a try statement. If you need to catch
ThreadDeath objects to detect a Thread
is about to die, the try statement that
catches ThreadDeath objects should rethrow them.
When an object is thrown out of the run()
method associated with a Thread, the uncaughtException()
method of the ThreadGroup for that Thread
is called.
The uncaughtException() method normally outputs a
stack trace. However, uncaughtException() treats a
ThreadDeath object as a special case by not
outputting a stack trace. When the
uncaughtException() method returns, the thread is dead.
The thread is never scheduled to run again.
If this Thread object's stop()
method is called before this thread is started, the ThreadDeath
object is thrown as soon as the thread is started.
public final synchronized void stop(Throwable o)
Parameters
o
The object to be thrown.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method causes this Thread object to
stop executing by throwing the given object.
Normally, the stop()
method that takes no arguments and throws a
ThreadDeath
object should be called instead of this method. However, if it is
necessary to stop a thread by throwing some other type of object,
this method can be used.
The object is thrown in this thread, even if the method is
called from a different thread. This thread is forced to stop whatever
it is doing and throw the Throwable object o.
If this thread was suspended, it is resumed; if it was sleeping,
it is awakened.
When an object is thrown out of the run()
method associated with a Thread, the uncaughtException()
method of the ThreadGroup for that Thread
is called. If the thrown object is not an instance of
the ThreadDeath class, uncaughtException()
calls the thrown object's printStackTrace() method
and then the thread dies. The thread
is never scheduled to run again.
If this Thread object's stop()
method is called before this thread is started, the ThreadDeath
object is thrown as soon as the thread is started.
suspend
public final void suspend()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method suspends a thread. The method causes this Thread
object to temporarily be ineligible to be run. The thread becomes
eligible to be run again after its resume() method
is called. Calling this method for a thread that is already suspended
has no effect.
toString
public String toString()
Returns
A string representation of this Thread object.
Overrides
Object.toString()
Description
This method returns a string representation of this Thread
object.
