Name
URLStreamHandler
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.net.URLStreamHandler
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later 
Description
The URLStreamHandler class 
is an abstract class that defines 
methods that encapsulate protocol-specific behavior. A stream handler protocol 
knows how to establish a connection for a particular protocol and how to 
parse the protocol-specific portion of a URL. An application does not normally 
create a URLStreamHandler directly; 
the appropriate subclass of URLStreamHandler 
is created by a URLStreamHandlerFactory. 
The main purpose of a subclass of URLStreamHandler 
is to create a URLConnection 
object for a given URL. The 
URLStreamHandler object creates 
an object of the appropriate subclass of URLConnection 
for the protocol type specified by the URL. In order for a URL 
object to handle a protocol type such as http, 
ftp, or nntp, 
it needs an object of the appropriate subclass of URLStreamHandler 
to handle the protocol-specific details. 
Class Summary
public abstract class java.net.URLStreamHandler extends java.lang.Object {
  // Protected Instance Methods
  protected abstract URLConnection openConnection(URL u) 
  protected void parseURL(URL u, String spec, int start, int limit);
  protected void setURL(URL u, String protocol, String host, 
                        int port, String file, String ref);
  protected String toExternalForm(URL u);
}
Protected Instance Methods
openConnection
   protected abstract URLConnection openConnection(URL u) throws IOException  
Parameters
u
The URL 
being connected to. 
Returns
The URLConnection object for 
the given URL. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method handles the protocol-specific details of establishing a connection 
to a remote resource specified by the URL. 
The connection should be handled just up to the point where the resource 
data can be downloaded. A ContentHandler 
then takes care of downloading the data and creating an appropriate object.
A subclass of URLStreamHandler 
must implement this method. 
parseURL
protected void parseURL(URL u, String spec, int start, int limit)
Parameters
u
A reference to a URL 
object that receives the results of parsing.
spec
The string representation 
of a URL to be parsed.
start
The offset at which 
to begin parsing the protocol-specific portion of the URL.
limit
The offset of the 
last character that is to be parsed. 
Description
This method parses the string representation of a URL into a URL 
object.
Some parts of the URL object 
may already be specified if spec 
specifies a relative URL. However, values for those parts in spec 
can override the inherited context.
The method only parses the protocol-specific portion of the URL. In other 
words, start should specify 
the character immediately after the first colon (:), which marks the termination 
of the protocol type, and limit 
should either be the last character in the string or the first pound sign 
(#), which marks the beginning of a protocol-independent anchor. Rather 
than return a result, the method calls the set() 
method of the specified URL 
object to set its fields to the appropriate values.
The implementation of the parseURL() 
method in URLStreamHandler 
parses the string representation as if it were an http 
specification. A subclass that implements a protocol stream handler for 
a different protocol must override this method to properly parse the URL. 
setURL
   protected void setURL(URL u, String protocol, String host, int port, String file, String ref)  
Parameters
u
A reference to a URL 
object to be modified.
protocol
A protocol.
host
A hostname.
port
A port number.
file
A filename.
ref
A reference. 
Description
This method sets the protocol, hostname, port number, filename, and reference 
of the given URL to the specified 
values by calling the set() 
method of the URL. Only subclasses 
of URLStreamHandler are allowed 
to call the set() method of 
a URL object. 
toExternalForm
protected String toExternalForm(URL u)
Parameters
u
The URL 
object to convert to a string representation. 
Returns
A string representation of the given URL. 
Description
This method unparses a URL 
object and returns a string representation of the URL.
The implementation of the toExternalForm() 
method in URLStreamHandler 
returns a string representation that is appropriate for an http 
specification. A subclass that implements a protocol stream handler for 
a different protocol must override this method to create a correct string 
representation.
