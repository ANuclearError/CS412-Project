Description
The Float class provides an object wrapper
for a float value. This is useful when you need
to treat a float value as an object. For example,
there are a number of utility methods that take a reference to an
Object as one of their arguments. You cannot
specify a float value for one of these arguments,
but you can provide a reference to a Float object
that encapsulates the float value. Furthermore,
as of JDK 1.1, the Float class is necessary to 
support the Reflection API and class literals.
In Java, float values are represented using
the IEEE 754 format. The Float class provides
constants for the three special values that are mandated by this format:
POSITIVE_INFINITY, NEGATIVE_INFINITY,
and NaN (not-a-number).
The Float class also provides some utility
methods, such as methods for determining whether a floatx
value is an infinity value or NaN, for converting float
values to other primitive types, and for converting a float
to a String and vice versa.

Constants
MAX_VALUE
public static final float MAX_VALUE = 3.40282346638528860e+38f
Description
The largest value that can be represented by a float.
MIN_VALUE
public static final float MIN_VALUE = 1.40129846432481707e-45f
Description
The smallest value that can be represented by a float.
NaN
public static final float NaN = 0.0f / 0.0f
Description
This variable represents the value NaN, a special value produced by float operations
such as division of zero by zero. When NaN is one of the operands,
most arithmetic operations return NaN as the result.
Most comparison operators (&lt;, &lt;=,
==, &gt;=, &gt;)
return false when one of their arguments is NaN.
The exception is !=, which returns true
when one of its arguments is NaN.
NEGATIVE_INFINITY
public static final float NEGATIVE_INFINITY = -1.0f / 0.0f
Description
This variable represents the value negative infinity, which
is produced when a float operation underflows
or a negative float value is divided by zero.
Negative infinity is by definition less than any other float
value.
POSITIVE_INFINITY
public static final float POSITIVE_INFINITY = 1.0f / 0.0f
Description
This variable represents the value positive infinity, which
is produced when a float operation overflows
or a positive float value is divided by zero.
Positive infinity is by definition greater than any other float
value.
TYPE
public static final Class TYPE 
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The Class object that represents the type
float.
It is always true that Float.TYPE 
== float.class.
Constructors
Float
public Float(double value)
Parameters
value
The double value to be encapsulated
by this object.
Description
Creates a Float object with the specified
double value. The value is rounded to float
precision.
public Float(float value)
Parameters
value
The float value to be encapsulated
by this object.
Description
Creates a Float object with the specified
float value.
public Float(String s) throws NumberFormatException
Parameters
s
The string to be made into a Float
object.
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the sequence of characters in the given String
does not form a valid float literal.
Description
Constructs a Float object with the value
specified by the given string. The string must contain a sequence
of characters that forms a legal float literal.
Class Methods
floatToIntBits
public static native int floatToIntBits(float value)
Parameters
value
The float value to be converted.
Returns
The int value that contains the same sequence
of bits as the representation of the given float value.
Description
This method returns the int value that
contains the same sequence of bits as the representation of the
given float value. The meaning of the bits in
the result is defined by the IEEE 754 floating-point format: bit
31 is the sign bit, bits 30-23 are the exponent, and bits 22-0 are
the mantissa. An argument of POSITIVE_INFINITY
produces the result 0x7f800000, an argument of
NEGATIVE_INFINITY produces the result 0xff800000,
and an argument of NaN produces the result 0x7fc00000.
The value returned by this method can be converted back to
the original float value by the
intBitsToFloat() method.
intBitsToFloat
public static native float intBitsToFloat(int bits)
Parameters
bits
The int value to be converted.
Returns
The float value whose representation is
the same as the bits in the given int value.
Description
This method returns the float value whose
representation is the same as the bits in the given int
value. The meaning of the bits in the int
value is defined by the IEEE 754 floating-point format: bit 31 is
the sign bit, bits 30-23 are the exponent, and bits 22-0 are the
mantissa. The argument 0x7f800000 produces the
result POSITIVE_INFINITY, and the argument 0xff800000
produces the result NEGATIVE_INFINITY. Arguments
in the ranges 0x7f800001 through 0x7f8fffff
and 0xff800001 through 0xff8fffffL
all produce the result NaN.
Except for NaN values not normally used by Java, this method
is the inverse of the floatToIntBits() method.
isInfinite
public static boolean isInfinite(float v)
Parameters
v
The float value to be tested.
Returns
true if the specified value is equal to
POSITIVE_INFINITY or NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not the specified value
is an infinity value.
isNaN
public static boolean isNaN(float v)
Parameters
v
The float value to be tested.
Returns
true if the specified value is equal to
NaN; otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not the specified value
is NaN.
toString
public static String toString(float f)
Parameters
f
The float value to be converted.
Returns
A string representation of the given value.
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains a representation of the given float value.
The values NaN, NEGATIVE_INFINITY, POSITIVE_INFINITY,
-0.0, and +0.0 are represented by
the strings "NaN",
"--Infinity", "Infinity",
"--0.0", and "0.0",
respectively.
For other values, the exact string representation depends
on the value being converted. If the absolute value of f
is greater than or equal to 10^-3 
or less than or equal to 10^7, it
is converted to a string with an optional minus sign (if the
value is negative) followed by up to eight digits
before the decimal point, a decimal point, and the necessary number
of digits after the decimal point (but no trailing zero if there is 
more than one significant digit).  There is always a minimum of
one digit after the decimal point.
Otherwise, the value is converted to a string with an optional
minus sign (if the value is negative), followed by a single digit,
a decimal point, the necessary number of digits after the decimal
point (but no trailing zero if there is more than one significant digit),
and the letter E followed by a plus or a minus 
sign and a base 10 exponent of at least one digit.  Again, there is always 
a minimum of one digit after the decimal point.
Note that the definition of this method has changed as of JDK 1.1.  
Prior to that release, the method provided a string representation
that was equivalent to the %g format of 
the printf function in C.
valueOf
   public static Float valueOf(String s) throws NumberFormatException  
Parameters
s
The string to be made into a Float
object.
Returns
The Float object constructed from the string.
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the sequence of characters in the given String
does not form a valid float literal.
Description
Constructs a Float object with the value
specified by the given string. The string must contain a sequence
of characters that forms a legal float literal.
This method ignores leading and trailing whitespace in the string.
Instance Methods
byteValue
public byte byteValue()
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Returns
The value of this object as a byte.
Overrides
Number.byteValue()
Description
This method returns the truncated value of this object as a
byte. More specifically, if the value of the object
is NaN, the method returns 0. If the value is
POSITIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
large to be represented by an byte, the method
returns Byte.MAX_VALUE. If the value is
NEGATIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
small to be represented by an byte, the method
returns Byte.MIN_VALUE. Otherwise, the value is
rounded toward zero and returned.
doubleValue
public double doubleValue()
Returns
The value of this object as a double.
Overrides
Number.doubleValue()
Description
This method returns the value of this object as a double.
equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Parameters
obj
The object to be compared with this object.
Returns
true if the objects are equal; false
if they are not.
Overrides
Object.equals()
Description
This method returns true if obj
is an instance of Float and it contains the same
value as the object this method is associated with. More specifically,
the method returns true
if the floatToIntBits()
method returns the same result for the values of both
objects.
This method produces a different result than the ==
operator when both values are NaN. In this case,
the == operator produces false,
while this method returns true. By the same token,
the method also produces a different result when the two values
are +0.0 and -0.0. In this
case, the == operator produces true,
while this method returns false.
floatValue
public float floatValue()
Returns
The value of this object as a float.
Overrides
Number.floatValue()
Description
This method returns the value of this object as a float.
hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns
A hashcode based on the float value of
the object.
Overrides
Object.hashCode()
Description
This method returns a hashcode computed from the value of
this object. More specifically, if f is the value
of the object, this method returns Float.floatToIntBits(f).
intValue
public int intValue()
Returns
The value of this object as an int.
Overrides
Number.intValue()
Description
This method returns the truncated value of this object as an
int. More specifically, if the value of the object
is NaN, the method returns 0. If the value is
POSITIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
large to be represented by an int, the method
returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. If the value is
NEGATIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
small to be represented by an int, the method
returns Integer.MIN_VALUE. Otherwise, the value is
rounded toward zero and returned.
isInfinite
public boolean isInfinite(float v)
Returns
true if the value of this object is equal
to POSITIVE_INFINITY or NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not the value of this object
is an infinity value.
isNaN
public boolean isNaN()
Returns
true if the value of this object is equal
to NaN; otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not the value of this object
is NaN.
longValue
public long longValue()
Returns
The value of this object as a long.
Overrides
Number.longValue()
Description
This method returns the truncated value of this object as a
long. More specifically, if the value of the object
is NaN, the method returns 0. If the value is
POSITIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
large to be represented by a long, the method
returns Long.MAX_VALUE. If the value is
NEGATIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
small to be represented by a long, the method
returns Long.MIN_VALUE. Otherwise, the value is
rounded toward zero and returned.
shortValue
public short shortValue()
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Returns
The value of this object as a short.
Overrides
Number.shortValue()
Description
This method returns the truncated value of this object as a
short. More specifically, if the value of the object
is NaN, the method returns 0. If the value is
POSITIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
large to be represented by an short, the method
returns Short.MAX_VALUE. If the value is
NEGATIVE_INFINITY, or any other value that is too
small to be represented by an short, the method
returns Short.MIN_VALUE. Otherwise, the value is
rounded toward zero and returned.
toString
public String toString()
Returns
A string representation of the value of this object.
Overrides
Object.toString()
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains a representation of the value of this object.
The values NaN, NEGATIVE_INFINITY,
POSITIVE_INFINITY, -0.0, and
+0.0 are represented by 
the strings "NaN", "--Infinity", 
"Infinity", "--0.0", 
and "0.0", respectively.
For other values, the exact string representation depends
on the value being converted. If the absolute value of this object
is greater than or equal to 10^-3 
or less than or equal to 10^7, it
is converted to a string with an optional minus sign (if the
value is negative) followed by up to eight digits
before the decimal point, a decimal point, and the necessary number
of digits after the decimal point (but no trailing zero if there is 
more than one significant digit).  There is always a minimum of
one digit after the decimal point.
Otherwise, the value is converted to a string with an optional
minus sign (if the value is negative), followed by a single digit,
a decimal point, the necessary number of digits after the decimal
point (but no trailing zero if there is more than one significant digit),
and the letter E followed by a plus or a minus 
sign and a base 10 exponent of at least one digit. Again, there is always 
a minimum of one digit after the decimal point.
