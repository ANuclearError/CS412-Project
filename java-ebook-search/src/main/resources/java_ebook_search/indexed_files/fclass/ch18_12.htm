Chapter 18The java.util.zip Package
InflaterInputStream
Name
InflaterInputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream
Superclass:
java.io.FilterInputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream, 
java.util.zip.ZipInputStream
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The InflaterInputStream class 
represents an InputStream with 
an associated Inflater. In 
other words, an InflaterInputStream 
wraps a regular input stream, so that data read from the stream is read 
from an underlying stream and decompressed. Two subclasses, GZIPInputStream 
and ZipInputStream, read compressed 
data in widely recognized formats. 
Class Summary
public class java.util.zip.InflaterInputStream
             extends java.io.FilterInputStream {
  // Variables
  protected byte[] buf;
  protected Inflater inf;
  protected int len;
  // Constructors
  public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in);
  public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in, Inflater inf);
  public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in, Inflater inf, int size);
  // Public Instance Methods
  public int read();
  public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len);
  public long skip(long n);
  // Protected Instance Methods
  protected void fill();
}
Variables
buf
protected byte[] buf
Description
A buffer that holds the compressed data that is written to the underlying 
stream. 
inf
protected Inflater inf
Description
The Inflater that is used internally. 
len
protected int len
Description
The amount of data that is in the input buffer. 
Constructors
InflaterInputStream
public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in)
Parameters
in
The underlying input stream. 
Description
This constructor creates an InflaterInputStream 
that reads data from the given InputStream. 
Before being read, the data is decompressed by a default Inflater. 
The InflaterInputStream uses 
a decompression buffer with the default size of 512 bytes. 
public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in, Inflater inf)
Parameters
in
The underlying input stream.
inf
The Inflater object. 
Description
This constructor creates an InflaterInputStream 
that reads data from the given InputStream. 
Before being read, the data is decompressed by the given Inflater. 
The InflaterInputStream uses 
a decompression buffer with the default size of 512 bytes. 
public InflaterInputStream(InputStream in, Inflater inf, int size)
Parameters
in
The underlying input stream.
inf
The Inflater object.
size
The size of the input buffer. 
Description
This constructor creates an InflaterInputStream 
that reads data from the given InputStream. 
Before being read, the data is decompressed by the given Inflater. 
The InflaterInputStream uses 
a decompression buffer of the given size. 
Instance Methods
read
public int read() throws IOException
Returns
The next uncompressed byte or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterInputStream.read() 
Description
This method reads enough data from the underlying InputStream 
to return a byte of uncompressed data. The method blocks until enough data 
is available for decompression, the end of the stream is detected, or an 
exception is thrown. 
public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to be filled from the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to read. 
Returns
The number of bytes read or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered 
immediately. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterInputStream.read(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method reads enough data from the underlying InputStream 
to return len bytes of uncompressed 
data. The uncompressed data is placed into the given array starting at 
off. The method blocks until 
some data is available for decompression. 
skip
public long skip(long n) throws IOException
Returns
The actual number of bytes skipped. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterInputStream.skip() 
Description
This method skips over the specified number of uncompressed data bytes 
by reading data from the underlying InputStream 
and decompressing it. 
Protected Instance Methods
fill
protected void fill() throws IOException
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method fills the input buffer with compressed data from the underlying 
InputStream.
