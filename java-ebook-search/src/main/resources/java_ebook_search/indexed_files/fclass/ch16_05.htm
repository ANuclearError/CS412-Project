CollationKey
Name
CollationKey
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.text.CollationKey
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The CollationKey class optimizes the sorting of many strings. The easiest 
way to compare strings is using Collator.compare(), 
but this can be inefficient, especially if the same strings are compared 
many times. Instead, you can create a CollationKey 
for each of your strings and compare the CollationKey 
objects to each other using the compareTo() 
method. A CollationKey is essentially 
a bit representation of a String 
object. Two CollationKey objects 
can be compared bitwise, which allows for a fast comparison. 
You cannot create CollationKey 
objects directly; you must create them through a specific Collator 
object using Collator.getCollationKey(). 
You can only compare CollationKey 
objects that have been generated from the same Collator. 
Class Summary
public final class java.text.CollationKey extends java.lang.Object {
  // Instance Methods
  public int compareTo(CollationKey target);
  public boolean equals(Object target); 
  public String getSourceString();
  public int hashCode();
  public byte[] toByteArray();
}
Instance Methods
compareTo
public int compareTo(CollationKey target)
Parameters
target
The key to compare 
with this CollationKey. 
Returns
-1 if this CollationKey is 
less than target, 0 if this 
CollationKey is equal to target, 
or 1 if this CollationKey is 
greater than target. 
Description
This method returns an integer that indicates the ordering of this CollationKey 
and the given CollationKey. 
Only CollationKey objects generated 
by the same Collator should 
be compared. 
equals
public boolean equals(Object target)
Parameters
target
The object to be 
compared with this object. 
Returns
true if the objects are equal; 
false if they are not. 
Overrides
Object.equals() 
Description
This method returns true if 
obj is an instance of CollationKey 
and is equivalent to this CollationKey. 
getSourceString
public String getSourceString()
Returns
The string that generated this CollationKey. 
Description
This method returns the string that was passed to Collator.getCollationKey() 
to create this CollationKey. 
hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns
A hashcode for this object. 
Overrides
Object.hashCode() 
Description
This method returns a hashcode for this CollationKey. 
toByteArray
public byte[] toByteArray()
Returns
A byte array that represents this CollationKey. 
Description
This method returns a byte array that represents the value of this CollationKey, 
with the most significant byte first.
