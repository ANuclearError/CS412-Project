1.6 The java.text Package
The java.text package is new in Java 1.1.
It contains classes that support the parsing and formatting of
data. These classes also support the internationalization of Java
programs.  Internationalization refers to 
the process of making a program flexible enough to run 
correctly in any locale. An internationalized program must,
however, be localized to enable it to run in a particular
locale. The internationalization capabilities in Java
are quite significant, especially in this age of the global
Internet.
Many of the classes in java.text are meant
to handle formatting string representations
of dates, times, numbers, and messages based on the conventions
of a locale. 
The Format class is the superclass of 
all of the classes that generate and parse string representations 
of various types of data. 
The DateFormat class formats and parses dates
and times according to the customs and language of a particular
locale. By the same token, the NumberFormat class
formats and parses numbers, including currency values, 
in a locale-dependent manner. 
The MessageFormat 
class creates a textual message from a pattern
string, while ChoiceFormat maps numerical
ranges to strings.
By themselves, these classes do not provide different results for
different locales. However, they can be used in conjunction with 
ResourceBundle objects from java.util
that generate locale-specific pattern strings.
The Collator class handles collating strings
according to the rules of a particular locale.
Different languages have different
characters and different rules for sorting those characters; 
Collator and its subclass, 
RuleBasedCollator, 
are designed to take those differences into account when collating
strings. In addition, 
the CollationKey class optimizes the sorting of a large collection of strings.
The BreakIterator class finds various
boundaries, such as word boundaries and line boundaries, in
textual data. As you might expect, BreakIterator
locates these boundaries according to the rules of a
particular locale.

classes in the java.text package.
