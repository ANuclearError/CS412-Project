Name
ContentHandler
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.net.ContentHandler
Superclass:
java.lang.Object
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later 
Description
The ContentHandler class is 
an abstract class that defines 
a method to read data from a URLConnection 
and then create an Object appropriate 
for the type of content it has read. Each subclass of ContentHandler 
handles a specific type of content (i.e., MIME type). 
You do not create ContentHandler 
objects directly; they are created by an object that implements the ContentHandlerFactory 
interface. A ContentHandlerFactory 
object selects and creates an appropriate ContentHandler 
for the content type. If you write your own ContentHandler 
subclasses, you should also write your own ContentHandlerFactory. 
The content handler factory for an application is set by a call to URLConnection.setContentHandlerFactory(). 
An application does not normally call the getContent() 
method of a ContentHandler 
directly; it should call URL.getContent() 
or URLConnection.getContent() 
instead. 
A ContentHandler works in conjunction 
with a URLStreamHandler, but 
their roles do not overlap. The URLStreamHandler 
deals with the specifics of a protocol, such as negotiating with a server 
to retrieve a resource, while the ContentHandler 
expects a data stream from which it can construct an object.
