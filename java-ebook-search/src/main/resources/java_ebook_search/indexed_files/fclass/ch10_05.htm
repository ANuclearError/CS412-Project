10.5 Garbage Collection
The garbage-collection process in Java normally runs continuously in
the background in a low-priority thread. In an environment that has
nonpreemptive thread scheduling, you may want to run the Java virtual
machine with the -noasyncgc option to ensure the
best possible response from your application. The
-noasyncgc option prevents garbage collection from
running in the background. In this case, the only time that garbage
collection occurs automatically is when the Java virtual machine runs
out of memory. Since this can cause unexpected pauses in a program,
you should try to avoid the problem by running the garbage collector
at convenient or appropriate times by calling
System.gc().
