Description
The ClassLoader class provides a mechanism
for Java to load classes over a network or from any source other
than the local filesystem. The default class-loading mechanism
loads classes from files found relative to directories specified
by the CLASSPATH
environment variable. This default mechanism does not use an instance
of the ClassLoader class.
An application can implement another mechanism for loading
classes by declaring a subclass of the abstract
ClassLoader class. A subclass of ClassLoader
must override the loadClass() to define a class-loading
policy. This method implements any sort of security that
is necessary for the class-loading mechanism. The other methods
of ClassLoader are final,
so they cannot be overridden.
A ClassLoader object is typically used
by calling its loadClass() method to explicitly
load a top-level class, such as a subclass of Applet.
The ClassLoader that loads the class becomes
associated with the class; it can be obtained by calling the getClassLoader() method of the Class object that represents
the class.
Once a class is loaded, it must be resolved before it can
be used. Resolving a class
means ensuring that all of the other classes it references
are loaded. In addition, all of the classes that they reference
must be loaded, and so on, until all of the needed classes have been
loaded. Classes are resolved using the resolveClass() method
of the ClassLoader object that loaded the initial
class. This means that when a ClassLoader object
is explicitly used to load a class, the same ClassLoader
is used to load all of the classes that it references, directly
or indirectly.
Classes loaded using a ClassLoader object may
attempt to load additional classes without explicitly using a
ClassLoader object. They can do this by calling the
Class class' forName() 
method. However, in such a situation, a ClassLoader
object is implicitly used. See the description of
Class.forName() for more information.
Java identifies a class by a combination of its fully
qualified name and the class loader that was used to load the
class. If you write a subclass of ClassLoader,
it should not attempt to directly load local classes. Instead,
it should call findSystemClass(). A local class
that is loaded directly by a ClassLoader is 
considered to be a different class than the same class loaded by
findSystemClass(). This can lead to having two
copies of the same class loaded, which can cause a number 
of inconsistencies. For example, the class' equals() 
method may decide that the same object is not equal to itself.

Constructors
ClassLoader
protected ClassLoader()
Throws
SecurityException
If there is a SecurityManager
object installed and its checkCreateClassLoader()
method throws a SecurityException when called
by this constructor.
Description
Initializes a ClassLoader object. Because
ClassLoader is an abstract class,
only subclasses of the class can access this constructor.
Class Methods
getSystemResource
public static final URL getSystemResource(String name)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
A system resource name.
Returns
A URL object that is connected to the specified
system resource or null if the resource cannot be found.
Description
This method finds a system resource with the given name and returns a
URL object that is connected to the resource.
The resource name can be any system resource.
getSystemResourceAsStream
public static final InputStream getSystemResourceAsStream(String name)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
A system resource name.
Returns
An InputStream object that is connected to the specified
system resource or null if the resource cannot be found.
Description
This method finds a system resource with the given name and returns an
InputStream object that is connected to the resource.
The resource name can be any system resource.
Public Instance Methods
getResource
public URL getResource(String name)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
A resource name.
Returns
A URL object that is connected to the specified
resource or null if the resource cannot be found.
Description
This method finds a resource with the given name and returns a
URL object that is connected to the resource.
A resource is a file that contains data (e.g., sound, images, text) 
and it can be part of a package. The name of a resource is
a sequence of identifiers separated by "/". For example, a
resource might have the name help/american/logon.html .
System resources are found on the host machine using the
conventions of the host implementation.  For example, 
the "/" in the resource name may be treated as a 
path separator, with the entire resource name treated as a relative path 
to be found under a directory in CLASSPATH.
The implementation of getResource() in 
ClassLoader simply returns null.
A subclass can override this method to provide more useful
functionality.
getResourceAsStream
public InputStream getResourceAsStream(String name)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
A resource name.
Returns
An InputStream object that is connected to the specified
resource or null if the resource cannot be found.
Description
This method finds a resource with the given name and returns an
InputStream object that is connected to the resource.
A resource is a file that contains data (e.g., sound, images, text) 
and it can be part of a package. The name of a resource is
a sequence of identifiers separated by `/'. For example, a
resource might have the name help/american/logon.html.
System resources are found on the host machine using the
conventions of the host implementation.  For example, 
the `/' in the resource name may be treated as a 
path separator, with the entire resource name treated as a relative path 
to be found under a directory in CLASSPATH.
The implementation of getResourceAsStream() in 
ClassLoader simply returns null.
A subclass can override this method to provide more useful
functionality.
loadClass
public Class loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
The name of the class to be returned. The class
name should be qualified by its package name. The lack of an explicit
package name specifies that the class is part of the default package.
Returns
The Class object for the specified class.
Throws
ClassNotFoundException
If it cannot find a definition for the named class.
Description
This method loads the named class by calling 
loadClass(name, true).
Protected Instance Methods
defineClass
   protected final Class defineClass(byte data[], int offset, int length)  
Availability
Deprecated as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
data
An array that contains the byte codes that define
a class.
offset
The offset in the array of byte codes.
length
The number of byte codes in the array.
Returns
The newly created Class object.
Throws
ClassFormatError
If the data array does not constitute
a valid class definition.
Description
This method creates a Class object from the byte codes that
define the class. Before the class can be used, it must be resolved.
The method is intended to be called from an implementation
of the loadClass() method.  
Note that this method is deprecated as of Java 1.1.  You should use
the version of defineClass() that takes a 
name parameter and is therefore more secure.
   protected final Class defineClass(String name, byte data[], int offset, int length)  
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
The expected name of the class to be defined or null if
it is not known.  The class name
should be qualified by its package name.  The lack of an explicit package
name specifies that the class is part of the default package.
data
An array that contains the byte codes that define
a class.
offset
The offset in the array of byte codes.
length
The number of byte codes in the array.
Returns
The newly created Class object.
Throws
ClassFormatError
If the data array does not constitute
a valid class definition.
Description
This method creates a Class object from the byte codes that
define the class. Before the class can be used, it must be resolved.
The method is intended to be called from an implementation
of the loadClass() method.
findLoadedClass
   protected final Class findLoadedClass(String name)  
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
name
The name of the class to be returned. The class
name should be qualified by its package name. The lack of an explicit
package name specifies that the class is part of the default package.
Returns
The Class object for the specified loaded class or
null if the class cannot be found.
Description
This method finds the specified class that has already been loaded.
findSystemClass
   protected final Class findSystemClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException  
Parameters
name
The name of the class to be returned. The class
name should be qualified by its package name. The lack of an explicit
package name specifies that the class is part of the default package.
Returns
The Class object for the specified system
class.
Throws
ClassNotFoundException
If the default class-loading mechanism cannot find
a definition for the class.
NoClassDefFoundError
If the
default class-loading mechanism cannot find the class.
Description
This method finds and loads a system class if it has not already
been loaded. A system class
is a class that is loaded by the default
class-loading mechanism from the local filesystem. An implementation
of the loadClass() method typically calls this
method to attempt to load a class from the locations specified by
the CLASSPATH environment variable.
loadClass
   protected abstract Class loadClass(String name, boolean resolve) throws ClassNotFoundException  
Parameters
name
The name of the class to be returned. The class
name should be qualified by its package name. The lack of an explicit
package name specifies that the class is part of the default package.
resolve
Specifies whether or not the class should be resolved
by calling the resolveClass() method.
Returns
The Class object for the specified class.
Throws
ClassNotFoundException
If it cannot find a definition for the named class.
Description
An implementation of this abstract method
loads the named class and returns its Class object.
It is permitted and encouraged for an implementation to cache the
classes it loads, rather than load one each time the method is called.
An implementation of this method should do at least the following:
Load the byte codes that comprise
the class definition into a byte[].
Call the defineClass() method
to create a Class object to represent the class
definition.
If the resolve parameter is true,
call the resolveClass() method to resolve the
class.
If an implementation of this method caches the classes that
it loads, it is recommended that it use an instance of the java.util.Hashtable
to implement the cache.
resolveClass
protected final void resolveClass(Class c)
Parameters
c
The Class object for the class to be resolved.
Description
This method resolves the given Class object.
Resolving a class means ensuring
that all of the other classes that the Class
object references are loaded. In
addition, all of the classes that they reference must be loaded,
and so on, until all of the needed classes have been loaded.
The resolveClass() method should be called
by an implementation of the loadClass() method
when the value of the loadClass() method's
resolve parameter is true.
setSigners
   protected final void setSigners(Class cl, Object[] signers)  
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
cl
The Class object for the class to be signed.
signers
An array of Objects that represents the signers
of this class.
Description
This method specifies the objects that represent the digital
signatures for this class.
