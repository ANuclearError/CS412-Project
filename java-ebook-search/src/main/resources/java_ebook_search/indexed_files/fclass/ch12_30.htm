Description
The Integer class provides an object wrapper
for an int value. This is useful when you need
to treat an int value as an object. For example,
there are a number of utility methods that take a reference to an
Object as one of their arguments. You cannot
specify an int value for one of these arguments,
but you can provide a reference to an Integer object
that encapsulates 
the int value. Also,
as of JDK 1.1, the Integer class is necessary to 
support the Reflection API and class literals.
The Integer class also provides a number
of utility methods for converting int values
to other primitive types and for converting int values
to strings and vice versa.

single `-' character. If the string contains any other characters, the constructor throws a NumberFormatException.
Class Methods
decode
public static Integer decode(String nm)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
nm
A String representation of the value to be 
encapsulated by an Integer object. If the 
string begins with # or 
0x, it is a radix 16 representation of the value.  
If the string begins with 0, it is a radix 
8 representation of the value. Otherwise, it is 
assumed to be a 
radix 10 representation of the value.
Returns
An Integer object that encapsulates the given value.
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String contains any nondigit characters 
other than a leading minus sign or the value represented by the 
String is less than Integer.MIN_VALUE
or greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Description
This method returns an Integer 
object that encapsulates the given value.
getInteger
public static Integer getInteger(String nm)
Parameters
nm
The name of a system property.
Returns
The value of the system property as an Integer object,
or an Integer object with the value 0 if the
named property does not exist or cannot be parsed.
Description
This method retrieves the value of the named system property
and returns it as an Integer object. The method
obtains the value of the system property as a String
using System.getProperty().
If the value of the property begins with 0x
or # and is not followed by a minus sign, the
rest of the value is parsed as a hexadecimal integer. If the value
begins with 0, it's parsed as an octal integer;
otherwise it's parsed as a decimal integer.
public static Integer getInteger(String nm, int val)
Parameters
nm
The name of a system property.
val
A default int value for the property.
Returns
The value of the system property as an Integer object,
or an Integer object with the value val
if the named property does not exist or cannot be parsed.
Description
This method retrieves the value of the named system property
and returns it as an Integer object. The method
obtains the value of the system property as a String
using System.getProperty().
If the value of the property begins with 0x
or # and is not followed by a minus sign, the
rest of the value is parsed as a hexadecimal integer. If the value
begins with 0, it's parsed as an octal integer;
otherwise it's parsed as a decimal integer.
public static Integer getInteger(String nm, Integer val)
Parameters
nm
The name of a system property.
val
A default Integer value for the
property.
Returns
The value of the system property as an Integer object,
or the Integer object val
if the named property does not exist or cannot be parsed.
Description
This method retrieves the value of the named system property
and returns it as an Integer object. The method
obtains the value of the system property as a String
using System.getProperty().
If the value of the property begins with 0x
or # and is not followed by a minus sign, the
rest of the value is parsed as a hexadecimal integer. If the value
begins with 0, it's parsed as an octal integer;
otherwise it's as a decimal integer.
parseInt
   public static int parseInt(String s) throws NumberFormatException  
Parameters
s
The String to be converted to
an int value.
Returns
The numeric value of the integer represented by the String
object.
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String does not contain
a valid representation of an integer.
Description
This method returns the numeric value of the integer represented
by the contents of the given String object. The
String must contain only decimal digits, except
that the first character may be a minus sign.
   public static int parseInt(String s, int radix) throws NumberFormatException  
Parameters
s
The String to be converted to
an int value.
radix
The radix used in interpreting the characters in
the String as digits. This value must be in the
range Character.MIN_RADIX to Character.MAX_RADIX.
If radix is in the range 2 through 10, only characters
for which the Character.isDigit() method returns
true are considered to be valid digits.
If radix
is in the range 11 through 36, characters in the ranges
`A' through `Z' and `a' through `z' may be considered valid digits.
Returns
The numeric value of the integer represented by the String
object in the specified radix.
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String does not contain
a valid representation of an integer, or radix
is not in the appropriate range.
Description
This method returns the numeric value of the integer represented
by the contents of the given String object in
the specified radix. The String must contain
only valid digits of the specified radix, except that the first
character may be a minus sign. The digits are parsed in the specified
radix to produce the numeric value.
toBinaryString
public static String toBinaryString(int value)
Parameters
value
The int value to be converted
to a string.
Returns
A string that contains the binary representation of the given
value.
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains the representation of the given value as an unsigned binary
number. To convert the given value to an unsigned quantity, the
method simply uses the value as if it were not negative. In other
words, if the given value is negative, the method adds
2^32 to it.
Otherwise the value is used as it is.
The string returned by this method contains a sequence of
one or more `0' and `1' characters. The method returns "0" if its
argument is 0. Otherwise, the string returned
by this method begins with `1'.
toHexString
public static String toHexString(int value)
Parameters
value
The int value to be converted
to a string.
Returns
A string that contains the hexadecimal representation of the
given value.
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains the representation of the given value as an unsigned hexadecimal
number. To convert the given value to an unsigned quantity, the
method simply uses the value as if it were not negative. In other
words, if the given value is negative, the method adds
2^32 to it.
Otherwise the value is used as it is.
The string returned by this method contains a sequence of
one or more of the characters `0', `1', `2', `3', `4', `5', `6',
`7', `8', `9', `a', `b', `c', `d', `e', and `f'. The method returns
"0" if its argument is
0. Otherwise, the string returned by this method
does not begin with `0'.
To produce a string that contains upper- instead
of lowercase letters, use the String.toUpperCase()
method.
toOctalString
public static String toOctalString(int value)
Parameters
value
The int value to be converted
to a string.
Returns
A string that contains the octal representation of the given
value.
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains a representation of the given value as an unsigned octal
number. To convert the given value to an unsigned quantity, the
method simply uses the value as if it were not negative. In other
words, if the given value is negative, the method adds
2^32 to it.
Otherwise the value is used as it is.
The string returned by this method contains a sequence of
one or more of the characters `0', `1', `2', `3', `4', `5', `6',
and `7'. The method returns "0" if its
argument is 0. Otherwise,
the string returned by this method does not begin with `0'.
toString
public static String toString(int i)
Parameters
i
The int value to be converted
to a string.
Returns
The string representation of the given value.
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains the decimal representation of the given value.
This method returns a string that begins with `-' if the given
value is negative. The rest of the string is a sequence of one or
more of the characters `0', `1', `2', `3', `4', `5', `6', `7', `8',
and `9'. This method returns "0" if its argument
is 0. Otherwise,
the string returned by this method does not begin with "0" or
"-0".
public static String toString(int i, int radix)
Parameters
i
The int value to be converted
to a string.
radix
The radix used in converting the value to a string.
This value must be in the range Character.MIN_RADIX
to Character.MAX_RADIX.
Returns
The string representation of the given value in the specified
radix.
Description
This method returns a String object that
contains the representation of the given value in the specified
radix.
This method returns a string that begins with `-' if the given
value is negative. The rest of the string is a sequence of one or
more characters that represent the magnitude of the given value.
The characters that can appear in the sequence are determined by
the value of radix. If N
is the value of radix, the first N
characters on the following line can appear in the sequence:
0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
The method does not verify that radix is
in the proper range. If radix is less than Character.MIN_RADIX
or greater than Character.MAX_RADIX, the value
10 is used instead of the given value.
This method returns "0" if its argument is 0.
Otherwise, the string returned by this method does not begin with
"0" or "-0".
