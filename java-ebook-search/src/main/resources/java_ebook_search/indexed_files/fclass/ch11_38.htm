Chapter 11The java.io Package
ObjectInput
Name
ObjectInput
Synopsis
Interface Name:
java.io.ObjectInput
Super-interface:
java.io.DataInput
Immediate Sub-interfaces:
None
Implemented By:
java.io.ObjectInputStream
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The ObjectInput interface extends 
the DataInput interface for 
object serialization. While DataInput 
defines methods for reading primitive types from a stream, ObjectInput 
defines methods for reading objects and arrays of bytes. 
Interface Declaration
public abstract interface java.io.ObjectInput extends java.io.DataInput {
  // Methods
  public abstract int available();
  public abstract void close();
  public abstract int read();
  public abstract int read(byte[] b);
  public abstract int read(byte[] b, int off, int len);
  public abstract Object readObject();
  public abstract long skip(long n);
}
Methods
available
public abstract int available() throws IOException
Returns
The number of bytes that can be read without blocking. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method returns the number of bytes that can be read from the stream 
without accessing a physical device, like a disk or a network. 
close
public abstract void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method closes the stream and releases any system resources associated 
with it. 
read
public abstract int read() throws IOException
Returns
The next byte of data or -1 if the end of the 
stream is encountered. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method returns the next byte of data from the stream. The method blocks 
until the byte is read, the end of stream is detected, or an exception 
is thrown. 
public abstract int read(byte[] b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to 
be filled from the stream. 
Returns
The actual number of bytes read or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered 
immediately. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads bytes from the stream to fill the given array. The method 
blocks until some data is available. 
   public abstract int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException  
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to 
be filled from the stream.
off
An offset into the 
array.
len
The number of bytes to read. 
Returns
The actual number of bytes read or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered 
immediately. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads up to len 
bytes of input into the given array starting at index off. 
The method blocks until some data is available. 
readObject
   public abstract Object readObject() throws ClassNotFoundException, IOException  
Returns
An Object that has been deserialized from the stream. 
Throws
ClassNotFoundException
If the class of the serialized object cannot be found in the run-time environment.
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads and returns an object instance from the stream; in 
other words, it deserializes an object from the stream. The class that 
implements this interface determines exactly how the object is to be read. 
skip
public abstract long skip(long n) throws IOException
Parameters
n
The number of bytes to skip. 
Returns
The actual number of bytes skipped. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method skips n bytes of input.
