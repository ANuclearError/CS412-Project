OutputStreamWriter
Name
OutputStreamWriter
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.OutputStreamWriter
Superclass:
java.io.Writer
Immediate Subclasses:
java.io.FileWriter
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The OutputStreamWriter class 
is a bridge between the byte-oriented world of the OutputStream 
class and the character-oriented world of the Writer 
class. The OutputStreamWriter 
represents a character stream, but it sends its output to an underlying 
byte stream. A character encoding scheme is responsible for translating the Unicode 
characters to bytes. An OutputStreamWriter 
can be created using an explicit encoding scheme or a default encoding 
scheme. 
For example, to write a Unicode character stream as an ISO-8859-5 byte 
stream, you can construct an OutputStreamWriter 
with the encoding 8859_5 as follows: 
OutputStreamWriter outr = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "8859_5");
Each time you write to an OutputStreamWriter 
object, bytes may be written to the underlying byte stream. To improve 
efficiency, you may want to wrap the OutputStreamWriter 
in a BufferedWriter.

Constructors
OutputStreamWriter
public OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream out)
Parameters
out
The output stream to 
use. 
Description
This constructor creates an OutputStreamWriter 
that writes its data to out 
and translates characters to bytes using the system's default encoding 
scheme. 
   public OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream out, String enc) throws UnsupportedEncodingException  
Parameters
out
The output stream to use.
enc
The name of an encoding scheme. 
Throws
UnsupportedEncodingException
If enc is not a supported encoding scheme. 
Description
This constructor creates an OutputStreamWriter 
that writes its data to out 
and translates characters to bytes using the given encoding scheme. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.close() 
Description
This method calls the close() 
method of the underlying output stream, which releases any system resources 
associated with this object. 
flush
public void flush() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.flush() 
Description
This method writes out any buffered data in the internal buffer and calls 
the flush() method of the underlying 
output stream, which forces any bytes that may be buffered to be written 
to the underlying device. 
getEncoding
public String getEncoding()
Returns
A String that contains the 
name of the character encoding scheme of this writer. 
Description
This method returns the name of the character encoding scheme this OutputStreamWriter 
is currently using. 
write
public void write(int c) throws IOException
Parameters
c
The value to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(int) 
Description
This method converts the given character to bytes using the current encoding 
scheme and places the converted bytes into an internal buffer. When the 
buffer fills up, it is written to the underlying byte stream. 
   public void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException  
Parameters
cbuf
An array of characters to write.
off
An offset into the character array.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(char[], int, int) 
Description
This method converts len characters 
from the array cbuf to bytes, 
starting at offset off, using 
the current encoding scheme. The method places the converted bytes into 
an internal buffer. When the buffer fills up, it is written to the underlying 
byte stream. 
public void write(String str, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
str
The string to be written.
off
An offset into start in the string.
len
The number of characters to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Writer.write(String, int, int) 
Description
This method converts len characters 
from the string str to bytes, 
starting at offset off, using 
the current encoding scheme. The method places the converted bytes into 
an internal buffer. When the buffer fills up, it is written to the underlying 
byte stream.
