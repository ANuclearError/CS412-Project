FilterOutputStream
Name
FilterOutputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.FilterOutputStream
Superclass:
java.io.ObjectStream
Immediate Subclasses:
java.io.BufferedOutputStream,
java.io.DataOutputStream,
java.io.PrintStream,
java.util.zip.CheckedOutputStream,
java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The FilterOutputStream class 
is the superclass of all of the output stream classes that filter output. 
Each of the subclasses of FilterOutputStream 
works by wrapping an existing output stream, called the underlying output 
stream, and providing additional functionality. The methods of FilterOutputStream 
simply override the methods of OutputStream 
with versions that call the corresponding methods of the underlying stream. 
FilterOutputStream cannot be 
instantiated directly; it must be subclassed. An instance of one of the 
subclasses of FilterOutputStream 
is constructed with another OutputStream 
object. The methods of a subclass of FilterOutputStream 
should override some methods in order to extend their behavior or 
provide some sort of filtering. 
Class Summary
public class java.io.FilterOutputStream extends java.io.OutputStream {
  // Variables
  protected OutputStream out;
  // Constructors
  public FilterOutputStream(OutputStream out);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void flush();
  public void write(int b);
  public void write(byte[] b); 
  public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len); 
}
Variables
out
protected OutputStream out
Description
The underlying stream that this FilterOutputStream 
wraps or filters. 
Constructors
FilterOutputStream
public FilterOutputStream(OutputStream out)
Parameters
out
The output stream to 
filter. 
Description
This constructor creates a FilterOutputStream 
that sends its data to out. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
OutputStream.close() 
Description
This method calls the close() 
method of the underlying stream, which releases any system resources associated 
with this object. 
flush
public void flush() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
OutputStream.flush() 
Description
This method calls the flush() 
method of the underlying stream, which forces any bytes that may be buffered 
by this FilterOutputStream 
to be written to the underlying device. 
write
public void write(int b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
The value to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
OutputStream.write(int) 
Description
This method writes a byte containing the low-order eight bits of the given 
integer value. The method calls the write(int) 
method of the underlying stream. 
public void write(byte[] b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to 
write to the stream. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
OutputStream.write(byte[]) 
Description
This method writes the bytes contained in the given array. To accomplish 
this, it calls write(b, 0, b.length). 
Subclasses need override only write(byte[], int, int) 
for this method to work automatically. 
public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to write. 
Throws
IOException
If 
any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method writes len bytes
contained in the given array, starting at offset
off.  It does this by calling
write(int) for each element to be written in the
array. This is inefficient, so subclasses should override
write(byte[], int, int) with a method that
efficiently writes a block of data.
