Description
The Error 
class is the superclass of all of the standard error classes that can be 
thrown in Java. The subclasses of Error 
are normally thrown by the class loader, the virtual machine, or other 
support code. Application-specific code should not normally throw any of 
the standard error classes. 
An Error 
or one of its subclasses is typically thrown when an unpredictable run-time 
error, such as running out of memory, occurs. Because of the unpredictable 
nature of the events that cause errors to be thrown, a method does not 
have to declare the Error 
class or any of its subclasses in the throws 
clause of its method declaration. 
A Java program should not try to handle the standard error classes. 
Most of these error classes represent nonrecoverable errors and as such, 
they cause the Java run-time system to print an error message and terminate 
program execution.
