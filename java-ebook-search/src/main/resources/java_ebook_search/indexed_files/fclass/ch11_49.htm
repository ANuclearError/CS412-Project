[Chapter 11] PipedOutputStream
Chapter 11The java.io Package
PipedOutputStream
Name
PipedOutputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.PipedOutputStream 
Superclass:
java.io.OutputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The PipedOutputStream 
class represents half of a communication pipe; a PipedOutputStream 
must be connected to a PipedOutputStream. 
When the two halves of a communication pipe are connected, data written 
to the PipedOutputStream can 
be read from the PipedInputStream. 
The communication pipe formed by a PipedOutputStream
and a PipedInputStream should be used to 
communicate between threads. If both ends of a pipe are used by
the same thread, the thread can hang.

Constructors
PipedOutputStream
public PipedOutputStream()
Description
This constructor creates a PipedOutputStream 
that is not connected to a PipedInputStream. 
The created object must be connected to a PipedInputStream 
before it can be used. 
public PipedOutputStream(PipedInputStream snk)
Parameters
snk
The PipedInputStream 
to connect. 
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This constructor creates a PipedOutputStream 
that sends data to the given PipedInputStream. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
OutputStream.close() 
Description
This method closes the stream and releases the system resources that are 
associated with it. 
connect
public void connect(PipedInputStream snk) throws IOException
Parameters
snk
The PipedInputStream 
to connect. 
Throws
IOException 
If another 
PipedInputStream is already 
connected to this PipedOutputStream 
or this PipedOutputStream is 
already connected. 
Description
This method connects this PipedOutputStream 
object to the given PipedInputStream. 
If this PipedOutputStream or 
snk is already connected, an 
exception is thrown. 
flush
public synchronized void flush() throws IOException
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs.
InterruptedIOException
While this method is waiting for buffer space to become available, if
the interrupted() method of the thread that invoked
this method is called.
Overrides
OutputStream.flush() 
Description
This method flushes the stream, which tells the connected PipedInputStream 
to notify its readers to read any available data. 
write
public void write(int b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
The value to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
InterruptedIOException
While this method is waiting for buffer space to become available, if
the interrupted() method of the thread that invoked
this method is called.
Overrides
OutputStream.write(int) 
Description
This method writes a byte of output. The method passes the given value 
directly to the connected PipedInputStream. 
public void write(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
InterruptedIOException
While this method is waiting for buffer space to become available, if
the interrupted() method of the thread that invoked
this method is called.
Overrides
OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method writes len bytes 
of output from the given array, starting at offset off. 
The method passes the given data to the connected PipedInputStream.
