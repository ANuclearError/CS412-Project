Name
ListResourceBundle
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.ListResourceBundle
Superclass:
java.util.ResourceBundle
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The ListResourceBundle class 
is an abstract subclass of 
ResourceBundle that represents 
a list of resources for a locale. 
The resources are listed as a set of 
key/value pairs. Internally, a Hashtable 
is used for quick lookup of values. To subclass ListResourceBundle, 
all you need to do is override getContents() 
to return a two-dimensional array of Objects 
that contains the key/value pairs. 
When ResourceBundle.getBundle() 
is called, it attempts to find a resource bundle that most closely matches 
a particular locale. This can be either a ListResourceBundle 
subclass or a property file, represented by a PropertyResourceBundle. 
Once the resource bundle has been retrieved, its contents can be used by 
the application to present locale-specific information. 
PropertyResourceBundle
inherits a lot of functionality from ResourceBundle;
see the class description of ResourceBundle for
more information.
Class Summary
public abstract class java.util.ListResourceBundle
                      extends java.util.ResourceBundle {
  // Instance Methods
  public Enumeration getKeys();
  public final Object handleGetObject(String key);
  // Protected Instance Methods
  protected abstract Object[][] getContents();
}
Instance Methods
getKeys
public Enumeration getKeys()
Returns
The keys in the resource bundle as an Enumeration. 
Overrides
ResourceBundle.getKeys() 
Description
This method returns an Enumeration 
that iterates through the keys in this ListResourceBundle. 
handleGetObject
public final Object handleGetObject(String key)
Parameters
key
The key of the resource 
to retrieve. 
Returns
The resource that corresponds to this key. 
Overrides
ResourceBundle.handleGetObject() 
Description
This method returns the resource that corresponds to the given key. 
This method should not be called directly by your code. 
Your code should call ResourceBundle.getObject(), 
which may call the handleGetObject() objects 
of multiple subclasses of ResourceBundle
looking for a particular resource. Calling handleGetObject()
directly only finds resources in the object associated with the method.
Protected Instance Methods
getContents
protected abstract Object[][] getContents()
Returns
The key/value pairs that represent the 
resources as a two-dimensional array. 
Description
This method returns a two-dimensional Object 
array that contains all the key/value pairs for this ListResourceBundle.
