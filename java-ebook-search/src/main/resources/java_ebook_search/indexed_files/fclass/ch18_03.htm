Chapter 18The java.util.zip Package
CheckedOutputStream
Name
CheckedOutputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.zip.CheckedOutputStream
Superclass:
java.io.FilterOutputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The CheckOutputStream class 
represents an OutputStream 
with an associated checksum. In other words, a CheckedOutputStream 
wraps a regular output stream and computes a checksum value as data is 
written to the stream. The checksum can verify the integrity 
of the data. When you create a CheckedOutputStream, 
you must specify an object that implements the Checksum 
interface that computes the checksum. 
Class Summary
public class java.util.zip.CheckedOutputStream
             extends java.io.FilterOutputStream {
  // Constructors
  public CheckedOutputStream(OutputStream out, Checksum cksum);
  
  // Instance Methods
  public Checksum getChecksum();
  public void write(int b);
  public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len);
}
Constructors
CheckedOutputStream
public CheckedOutputStream(OutputStream out, Checksum cksum)
Parameters
out
The underlying output stream.
cksum
The checksum object. 
Description
This constructor creates a CheckedOutputStream 
that writes data to the given OutputStream 
and updates the given Checksum. 
Instance Methods
getChecksum
public Checksum getChecksum()
Returns
The Checksum associated with 
this output stream. 
Description
This method returns the Checksum 
object associated with this output stream. 
write
public void write(int b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
The value to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterOutputStream.write(int) 
Description
This method writes a byte that contains the lowest eight bits of the given 
integer value to the underlying OutputStream 
and then updates the checksum. 
public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
b
An array of bytes to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
FilterOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method writes len bytes 
to the underlying OutputStream 
from the given array, starting at off. 
The checksum is then updated with the data that has been written.
