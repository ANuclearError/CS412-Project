Description
The URLStreamHandlerFactory 
interface defines a method that creates a URLStreamHandler 
object for a specific protocol. The interface is implemented by classes 
that select URLStreamHandler 
subclasses to process particular protocol types. 
The URL class uses a URLStreamHandlerFactory 
to create URLStreamHandler 
objects. The protocol type is determined by the portion of the URL up to 
the first colon. For example, given the following URL: 
http://www.tolstoi.org/ilych.html
the protocol type is http. 
A URLStreamHandlerFactory that 
recognizes http returns a URLStreamHandler 
that can process the URL.
