The java.lang.System and
java.lang.Runtime classes provide a variety of
methods that allow a Java program to access information and resources
for the environment in which it is running. This environment includes
the Java virtual machine and the native operating system.
10.1 I/O
The System class defines three 
static variables for the three 
default I/O stream objects that are used by Java programs: 
in
This variable refers to an InputStream 
that is associated with the process's standard input. 
out
This variable refers to a PrintStream 
object that is associated with the process's standard output. In an 
applet environment, the PrintStream 
is likely to be associated with a separate window or a file, although this 
is not guaranteed.
This stream is the most commonly used of the three I/O streams provided 
by the System class. Even in 
GUI-based applications, sending output to this stream can be useful for 
debugging purposes. The usual idiom for sending output to this stream is: 
System.out.println("some string");
err
This variable refers to a PrintStream 
object that is associated with the process's standard error output. 
In an applet environment, the PrintStream 
is likely to be associated with a separate window or a file, although this 
is not guaranteed.
