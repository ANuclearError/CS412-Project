7.3 Versioning of Classes
One you have written a class that works with serialization, the next concern 
is that serialized instances of that class can be deserialized by programs 
that use a different version of the same class. 
After a class is written, it is often necessary to modify its
definition as requirements change or new features are
needed. Deserialization may fail if the definition of a class in use
when an instance was serialized is different than the definition in
use when the instance is deserialized.  If you do not take any
measures to assure the serialization mechanism that the two classes
are different versions of the same class, deserialization fails by
throwing an InvalidClassException.  And even if the
serialization mechanism is satisfied that the two class definitions
represent different versions of the same class, it may find
incompatible differences between the definitions.
The following changes to the definition of a class are noticed by the
serialization mechanism:
Adding or deleting instance variables. 
Moving a class up or down the inheritance hierarchy. 
Making a non-static, non-transient 
variable either static or transient 
has the same effect as deleting the variable. Similarly, changing a variable 
that is static or transient 
to be non-static or non-transient 
has the same effect as adding the variable. 
Changing the data type of a transient 
variable from a primitive data type to an object reference type or from 
an object reference type to a primitive data type. 
Changing the readObject() 
or writeObject() method of 
a class so that it calls defaultReadObject() 
or defaultWriteObject() when 
it did not previously, or so that it does not call one of these methods 
when it did previously. The removal or addition of a readObject() 
or writeObject() method that 
does not call defaultReadObject() 
or defaultWriteObject() has 
a similar effect. 
Changing a class from Serializable 
to Externalizable or from Externalizable 
to Serializable. 
It's possible to code around some of these problems if you can first
convince the serialization mechanism that the two class definitions
are different versions of the same class. In order to convince the
serialization mechanism of such a thing, the class definition used for
deserialization of an object must define a static
final  long variable named
serialVersionUID.  If the class used for
serialization also defined that variable with the same value, the two
class definitions are assumed to define different versions of the same
class.
If the class used for serialization does not define
serialVersionUID, the serialization mechanism
performs the comparison using a value that is computed by calling the
ObjectStreamClass.getSerialVersionUID()
method. That computation is based on the fields defined by the
class. To take advantage of this automatic computation when you define
serialVersionUID, you should use the
serialver program that comes with the JDK to
determine the appropriate value for
serialVersionUID. The
serialver program computes a value for
serialVersionUID by calling the
ObjectStreamClass.getSerialVersionUID() method.
Assuming you've convinced the serialization mechanism that the two
class definitions represent different versions of the same class, here
is some advice on how to deal with the differences that can be worked
around:
Missing variables
If the class used to deserialize an object defines variables the class 
used to serialize the object did not define, the serialized object does 
not contain any values for those variables. This situation can also arise 
if the class used to serialize the object defined a variable as static 
or transient, while the class 
used to deserialize the object defines it as non-static 
or non-transient.
When an object is deserialized and there are variables missing in its
serialized form, the variables in the deserialized object are set to
default values. In other words, the value of such a variable is
true if it has an arithmetic data type,
false if it has a boolean data
type, or null if it has an object reference
type. Deserialization ignores intializers in variable declarations.
When you add variables to a Serializable 
class, consider the possibility that the new version of the class will deserialize an object serialized with an older version of the 
class. If that happens and it is unacceptable for the new variables to 
have default values after deserialization, you can define a validateObject() 
method for the class to check for the default values and provide acceptable 
values or throw an InvalidObjectException. 
Extra variables
If the serialized form of an object contains values for variables that
are not defined by the class used to deserialize that object, the values 
are read and then ignored. If the value of such a variable is an object, 
the object is created and immediately becomes a candidate for garbage collection. 
Missing classes
If the class used to deserialize an object inherits from an ancestor
class that the class used to serialize the object did not inherit
from, the serialized object does not contain any values for the
variables of the additional ancestor class. Just as with missing
variables, those variables are deserialized with their default values.
When you add an ancestor class to a Serializable 
class, consider the possibility that the new version of the class will deserialize an object serialized with an older version of the 
class. If that happens and it is unacceptable for instance variables in 
the new ancestor class to have default values after deserialization, you 
can define a validateObject() 
method for the class to check for the default values and provide acceptable 
values or throw an InvalidObjectException. 
Extra classes
If the class used to serialize an object inherits from an ancestor class 
that the class used to deserialize the object does not inherit from, the 
values for the variables defined by that extra ancestor class are read 
but not used. 
Adding writeObject() and
readObject() methods
You can add writeObject() and 
readObject() methods to a class 
that did not have them. In order to deserialize objects that were serialized 
using the older class definition, the new methods must begin by calling 
defaultWriteObject() and defaultReadObject(). 
That ensures that information written out using default logic is still 
processed using default logic.
If the writeObject() and
readObject() methods write and read additional
information to and from the byte stream, you should also add an
additional variable to the class to serve as a version indicator. For
example, you might declare an int variable and
initialize it to one. If, after defaultReadObject()
returns, the value of that variable is 0, you know
the object was serialized using the old class definition and that any
additional information that would have been written by the
writeObject() method will not be there.
Removing writeObject() and 
readObject() methods
If you remove writeObject() and
readObject() methods from a class and deserialize
an object using the new class definition, the information written by a
call to writeObject() is simply read by the default
logic and any additional information is ignored.
Changing a class so that it implements Serializable
If a superclass of an object did not implement
Serializable when the object was serialized, and
that superclass does implement Serializable when
the object is deserialized, the result is similar to the missing class
situation. There is no information about the variables of the newly
Serializable superclass in the byte stream, so its
instance variables are initialized to default values.
Changing a class so that it does not implement
Serializable
If a superclass of an object implemented
Serializable when the object was serialized, and
that superclass does not implement Serializable
when the object is deserialized, the result is similar to the extra
class situation. The information in the byte stream for that class is
read and discarded.
