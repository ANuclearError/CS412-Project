CharacterIterator
Name
CharacterIterator
Synopsis
Interface Name:
java.text.CharacterIterator
Super-interface:
java.lang.Cloneable
Immediate Sub-interfaces:
None
Implemented By:
java.text.StringCharacterIterator
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The CharacterIterator interface 
defines methods that support bidirectional movement through a sequence 
of text. The interface is implemented by classes that maintain a current 
position in a sequence of characters. The interface provides methods for 
moving to the first, last, next, and previous characters in the sequence. 
The BreakIterator classes uses 
this interface to locate boundaries in textual sequences. 
Class Summary

  // Methods
  public abstract Object clone();
  public abstract char current();
  public abstract char first();
  public abstract int getBeginIndex();
  public abstract int getEndIndex();
  public abstract int getIndex();
  public abstract char last();
  public abstract char next();
  public abstract char previous();
  public abstract char setIndex(int position);
}
Constants
DONE
public final static char DONE
Description
A constant that indicates that the beginning or end of the text has been 
reached. It can be returned by next() 
or previous(). 
Methods
clone
public abstract Object clone()
Returns
A copy of this CharacterIterator. 
Overrides
Object.clone() 
Description
This method creates a copy of this CharacterIterator 
and returns it. 
current
public abstract char current()
Returns
The character at the current position of this 
CharacterIterator or DONE 
if the current position is not within the text sequence. 
Description
This method returns the character at the current position of this CharacterIterator. 
The current position is returned by getIndex(). 
first
public abstract char first()
Returns
The first character in this CharacterIterator. 
Description
This method returns the character at the first position in this CharacterIterator. 
The first position is returned by getBeginIndex(). 
The current position of the iterator is set to this position. 
getBeginIndex
public abstract int getBeginIndex()
Returns
The index of the first character in this CharacterIterator. 
Description
This method returns the index of the beginning of the text for this CharacterIterator. 
getEndIndex
public abstract int getEndIndex()
Returns
The index after the last character in this CharacterIterator. 
Description
This method returns the index of the character following the end of the 
text for this CharacterIterator. 
getIndex
public abstract int getIndex()
Returns
The index of the current character in this CharacterIterator. 
Description
This method returns the current position, or index, of this CharacterIterator. 
last
public abstract char last()
Returns
The last character in this CharacterIterator. 
Description
This method returns the character at the ending position of this CharacterIterator. 
The last position is the value of getEndIndex()-1. 
The current position of the iterator is set to this position. 
next
public abstract char next()
Returns
The next character in this CharacterIterator 
or DONE if the current position 
is already at the end of the text. 
Description
This method increments the current position of this CharacterIterator 
by one and returns the character at the new position. If the current position 
is already at getEndIndex(), 
the position is not changed, and DONE 
is returned. 
previous
public abstract char previous()
Returns
The previous character in this CharacterIterator 
or DONE if the current position 
is already at the beginning of the text. 
Description
This method decrements the current position of this CharacterIterator 
by one and returns the character at the new position. If the current position 
is already at getBeginIndex(), 
the position is not changed, and DONE 
is returned. 
setIndex
public abstract char setIndex(int position)
Parameters
position
The new position. 
Returns
The character at the specified position in this CharacterIterator. 
Throws
IllegalArgumentException
If the given position is not between getBeginIndex() 
and getEndIndex()-1. 
Description
This method sets the current position, or index, of this CharacterIterator 
to the given position.
