Chapter 11The java.io Package
PipedReader
Name
PipedReader
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.PipedReader
Superclass:
java.io.Reader
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1
Description
The PipedReader 
class represents half of a communication pipe; a PipedReader 
must be connected to a PipedWriter. 
When the two halves of a communication pipe are connected, data written 
to the PipedWriter can be read 
from the PipedReader. 
The communication pipe formed by a PipedReader
and a PipedWriter should be used to 
communicate between threads. If both ends of a pipe are used by
the same thread, the thread can hang.
The PipedReader class is the 
character-based equivalent of the byte-based PipedInputStream. 
Class Summary
public class java.io.PipedReader extends java.io.Reader {
  // Constructors
  public PipedReader();
  public PipedReader(PipedWriter src);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void connect(PipedWriter src);
  public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len);
}
Constructors
PipedReader
public PipedReader ()
Description
This constructor creates a PipedReader 
that is not connected to a PipedWriter. 
The created object must be connected to a PipedWriter 
before it can be used. 
public PipedReader(PipedWriter src) throws IOException
Parameters
src
The PipedWriter 
to connect. 
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This constructor creates a PipedReader 
that receives data from the given PipedWriter. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind 
of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
Reader.close() 
Description
This method closes the reader and releases the system resources that are 
associated with it. 
connect
public void connect(PipedWriter src) throws IOException
Parameters
src
The PipedWriter 
to connect. 
Throws
IOException 
If another 
PipedWriter is already connected 
to this PipedReader. 
Description
This method connects the given PipedWriter 
to this PipedReader 
object. If there is already a connected PipedWriter, 
an exception is thrown. 
read
public int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
cbuf
An array of characters to be filled.
off
An offset into the array.
len
The number of characters to read. 
Returns
The actual number of characters read or -1 if the end of the stream is 
encountered immediately. 
Throws
IOException
If the pipe is broken. In other words, if this
PipedReader is closed or if the connected
PipedWriter is dead.
InterruptedIOException
While this method is waiting for input, if the
interrupted() method of the thread that invoked
this method is called.
Overrides
Reader.read(char[], int, int) 
Description
This method copies characters from the pipe buffer into the given array 
cbuf, starting at index off 
and continuing for len characters. 
If there is at least one character in the buffer, the method returns as 
many characters as are in the buffer (up to len). 
If the buffer is empty, the method blocks until data is written to the 
connected PipedWriter.
