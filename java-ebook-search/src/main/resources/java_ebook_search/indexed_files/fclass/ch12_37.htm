java.lang.Object

Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The Math class contains constants for the
mathematical values pi and e. The class also
defines methods that compute various mathematical functions, such
as trigonometric and exponential functions. All of these constants
and methods are static. In other words, it
is not necessary to create an instance of the Math
class in order to use its constants and methods. In fact, the Math
class does not define any public constructors,
so it cannot be instantiated.
To ensure that the methods in this class return consistent
results under different implementations of Java, all of the methods
use the algorithms from the well-known Freely-Distributable Math
Library package, fdlibm. This package is part
of the network library netlib. The library
can be obtained through the URL http://netlib.att.com.
The algorithms used in this class are from the version of fdlibm
dated January 4, 1995. fdlibm provides more
than one definition for some functions. In those cases, the "IEEE
754 core function" version is used.
