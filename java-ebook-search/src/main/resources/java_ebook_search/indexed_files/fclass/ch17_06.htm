Name
Enumeration
Synopsis
Interface Name:
java.util.Enumeration
Super-interface:
None
Immediate Sub-interfaces:
None
Implemented By:
java.util.StringTokenizer
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later 
Description
An object that implements the Enumeration 
interface provides a way to access a set of objects sequentially.
The Enumeration object hides the actual
organization of the set of objects from the code that is using it.
An Enumeration 
can iterate through, or enumerate, its set of objects one at a time. A 
specific implementation of the interface controls the order in which the 
objects are presented. 
The following is an example of how an Enumeration 
is used. The example shows a method for printing the values in an Enumeration: 
void printAll(Enumeration e) {
    while ( e.hasMoreElements() ) {
        System.out.println(e.nextElement());
    }
}
Note that an Enumeration can 
be used only once: it iterates through its collection of objects in one 
direction and cannot be reset or rewound. 
Normally, an Enumeration 
is not instantiated directly, but instead returned by a method that needs 
to enumerate a set of values. For example, the elements() 
method of the Vector class 
returns an Enumeration of the 
elements in the Vector. By 
the same token, the elements() 
and keys() methods of the Hashtable 
class return Enumeration objects 
for the keys and values in the Hashtable. 
Interface Declaration
public abstract interface java.util.Enumeration {
  // Methods
  public abstract boolean hasMoreElements();
  public abstract Object nextElement() throws NoSuchElementException;
}
Methods
hasMoreElements
public abstract boolean hasMoreElements()
Returns
true if the there are more 
objects to retrieve; false 
otherwise. 
Description
This method returns true if 
the nextElement() 
method of this Enumeration 
returns an object the next time it is called. 
nextElement
public abstract Object nextElement()
Returns
The next object in this Enumeration. 
Throws
NoSuchElementException
If there are no more objects to return. 
Description
This method returns the next object in the set of objects encapsulated 
by this Enumeration.
