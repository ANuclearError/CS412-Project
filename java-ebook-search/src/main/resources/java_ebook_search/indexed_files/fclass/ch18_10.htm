Chapter 18The java.util.zip Package
GZIPOutputStream
Name
GZIPOutputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream
Superclass:
java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The GZIPOutputStream class 
compresses data using the GZIP format. To use it, simply construct a GZIPOutputStream 
that wraps a regular output stream and use the write() 
methods to write compressed data. 
Class Summary
public class java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream
             extends java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream {
  // Variables
  protected CRC32 crc;
  // Constructors
  public GZIPOutputStream(OutputStream out);
  public GZIPOutputStream(OutputStream out, int size);
  // Instance Methods
  public void close();
  public void finish();
  public synchronized void write(byte[] buf, int off, int len);
}
Variables
crc
protected CRC32 crc
Description
A checksum that is updated with the uncompressed stream data. The checksum 
value is written into the GZIP trailer. 
Constructors
GZIPOutputStream
public GZIPOutputStream(OutputStream out) throws IOException
Parameters
out
The underlying output stream. 
Throws
IOException
If an error occurs while writing the GZIP header. 
Description
This constructor creates a GZIPOutputStream 
that writes compressed data to the given OutputStream. 
The GZIPOutputStream uses a 
compression buffer with the default size of 512 bytes. 
   public GZIPOutputStream(OutputStream out, int size) throws IOException  
Parameters
out
The underlying output stream.
size
The size of the output buffer. 
Throws
IOException
If an error occurs while writing the GZIP header. 
Description
This constructor creates a GZIPOutputStream 
that writes compressed data to the given OutputStream. 
The GZIPOutputStream uses a 
compression buffer of the given size. 
Instance Methods
close
public void close() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
DeflaterOutputStream.close() 
Description
This method closes the stream and releases any system resources that are associated with it. 
finish
public void finish() throws IOException
Throws
IOException 
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
DeflaterOutputStream.finish() 
Description
This method finishes writing compressed data to the underlying stream without 
closing it. 
write
public void write(byte[] buf, int off, int len) throws IOException
Parameters
buf
An array of bytes to write to the stream.
off
An offset into the byte array.
len
The number of bytes to write. 
Throws
IOException
If any kind of I/O error occurs. 
Overrides
DeflaterOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method takes len bytes 
from the given buffer, starting at off, 
and compresses them. The method then writes the compressed data to the 
underlying OutputStream. The 
method blocks until all of the bytes have been written.
