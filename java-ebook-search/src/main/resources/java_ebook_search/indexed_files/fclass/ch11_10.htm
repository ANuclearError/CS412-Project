Name
DataInput 
Synopsis
Interface Name:
java.io.DataInput
Super-interface:
None
Immediate Sub-interfaces:
java.io.ObjectInput
Implemented By:
java.io.DataInputStream, 
java.io.RandomAccessFile
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
The DataInput interface defines 
methods for reading primitive data types and lines of text from an input 
stream in a machine-independent manner. All multibyte quantities are assumed 
to be in a format that stores the most significant byte as the first byte 
and the least significant byte as the last byte. 
Interface Declaration
public abstract interface java.io.DataInput {
  // Methods
  public abstract boolean readBoolean();
  public abstract byte readByte();
  public abstract char readChar();
  public abstract double readDouble();
  public abstract float readFloat();
  public abstract void readFully(byte[] b);
  public abstract void readFully(byte[] b, int off, int len);
  public abstract int readInt();
  public abstract String readLine();
  public abstract long readLong();
  public abstract short readShort();
  public abstract int readUnsignedByte();

Methods
readBoolean
public abstract boolean readBoolean() throws IOException
Returns
The boolean value read from 
the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
 
This method reads a byte as a
boolean value. A byte that contains a zero is read
as false; that which contains a nonzero is read as
true.
readByte
public abstract byte readByte() throws IOException
Returns
The byte value read from the 
stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a signed 8-bit byte. 
readChar
public abstract char readChar() throws IOException
Returns
The char value read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 16-bit char. 
readDouble
public abstract double readDouble() throws IOException
Returns
The double value read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 64-bit double 
quantity. 
readFloat
public abstract float readFloat() throws IOException
Returns
The float value read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 32-bit float 
quantity. 
readFully
public abstract void readFully(byte[] b) throws IOException
Parameters
b
The array to fill. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads bytes into the given array b 
until the array is full. 
   public abstract void readFully(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException  
Parameters
b
The array to fill.
off
An offset into the array.
len
The number of bytes to read. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads len bytes into the given array, starting 
at offset off. 
readInt
public abstract int readInt() throws IOException
Returns
The int value read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 32-bit int 
quantity. 
readLine
public abstract String readLine() throws IOException
Returns
A String that contains the 
line read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a String from the current
position through the next line terminator. Implementations of this
method should take care to look for any line terminator:
"\n", "\r", or
"\r\n".
readLong
public abstract long readLong() throws IOException
Returns
The long value read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 64-bit long quantity. 
readShort
public abstract short readShort() throws IOException
Returns
The short value read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 16-bit short quantity. 
readUnsignedByte
public abstract int readUnsignedByte() throws IOException
Returns
The unsigned byte value read 
from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads an 8-bit byte 
as an unsigned quantity. 
readUnsignedShort
public abstract int readUnsignedShort() throws IOException
Returns
The unsigned short value read 
from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method reads a 16-bit short 
as an unsigned quantity. 
readUTF
public abstract String readUTF() throws IOException
Returns
The String read from the stream. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs.
UTFDataFormatException
If the bytes do not represent a valid UTF-8 encoding. 
Description
This method reads a UTF-8 format String. 
See Appendix B, The UTF-8 Encoding, for information on the UTF-8 encoding.
skipBytes
public abstract int skipBytes(int n) throws IOException
Parameters
n
The number of bytes to 
skip. 
Returns
The actual number of skipped bytes. 
Throws
EOFException
If the end of the file is encountered.
IOException
If any other kind of I/O error occurs. 
Description
This method skips over n bytes.
