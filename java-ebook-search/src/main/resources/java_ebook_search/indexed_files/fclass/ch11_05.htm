Name
ByteArrayInputStream
Synopsis
Class Name:
java.io.ByteArrayInputStream
Superclass:
java.io.InputStream
Immediate Subclasses:
None
Interfaces Implemented:
None
Availability:
JDK 1.0 or later
Description
A ByteArrayInputStream 
is a stream whose data comes from a byte array. None of the methods of 
this class throw an IOException 
because the data comes from an array instead of an actual I/O device. 
This class does not support the ability to mark a position in the stream. 
A call to reset(), however, 
does position the stream at the beginning of the byte array. 
The position of the end of the stream depends on the constructor used. 
If the ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] buf) 
constructor is used, the end of the stream is the end of the byte array. 
If the ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] buf, int offset, int 
length) constructor is used, the end of the 
stream is reached at the index given by offset+length. 
Class Summary
public class java.io.ByteArrayInputStream extends java.io.InputStream {
  // Variables
  protected byte[] buf;
  protected int count;
  protected int pos;
  // Constructors
  public ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] buf);
  public ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] buf, int offset, int length);
  // Instance Methods
  public synchronized int available();
  public synchronized int read();
  public synchronized int read(byte[] b, int off, int len);
  public synchronized void reset();
  public synchronized long skip(long n); 
}
Variables
buf
protected byte[] buf
Description
The buffer represented by this stream. 
count
protected int count
Description
A placeholder that marks the end of the data this ByteArrayInputStream 
represents. 
pos
protected int pos
Description
The current position in the buffer. 
Constructors
ByteArrayInputStream
public ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] buf)
Parameters
buf
The stream source. 
Description
This constructor creates a ByteArrayInputStream 
object that uses the given array of bytes as its data source. The data 
is not copied, so changes made to the array affect the data the ByteArrayInputStream 
returns. 
public ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] buf, int offset, int length)
Parameters
buf
The stream source.
offset
An index into the buffer where the stream should begin.
length
The number of bytes to read. 
Description
This constructor creates a ByteArrayInputStream 
that uses, as its data source, length 
bytes in a given array of bytes, starting at offset 
bytes from the beginning of the array. The data is not copied, so changes 
made to the array affect the data the ByteArrayInputStream 
returns. 
Instance Methods
available
public synchronized int available()
Returns
The number of bytes remaining to be read in the array. 
Overrides
InputStream.available() 
Description
This method returns the number of bytes remaining to be read in the byte 
array. 
read
public synchronized int read()
Returns
The next byte or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered. 
Overrides
InputStream.read() 
Description
This method returns the next byte in the array. 
public synchronized int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)
Parameters
b
An array to read bytes into.
off
An offset into b.
len
The number of bytes to read. 
Returns
The number of bytes read or -1 if the end of the stream is encountered. 
Overrides
InputStream.read(byte[], int, int) 
Description
This method copies up to len 
bytes from its internal byte array into the given array b, 
starting at index off. 
reset
public synchronized void reset()
Overrides
InputStream.reset() 
Description
This method resets the position of the input stream to the beginning of 
the byte array. If you specified an offset into the array, you might expect 
this method to reset the position to where you first started reading from 
the stream, but that is not the case. 
skip
public synchronized long skip(long n)
Parameters
n
The number of bytes to skip. 
Returns
The number of bytes skipped. 
Overrides
InputStream.skip() 
Description
This method skips n bytes of input. If you try to skip 
past the end of the array, the stream is positioned at the end of the array.
