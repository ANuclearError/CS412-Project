Description
The Cloneable
interface provides no functionality; it declares no methods
or variables. This interface is simply provided as a way of indicating
that an object can be cloned (that is, copied). A class that is declared
as implementing this interface is assumed to have overridden the
Object class' implementation of clone() with an implementation that can successfully clone instances
of the class. The implementation of clone() that is
provided by the Object class simply throws
a CloneNotSupportedException.
