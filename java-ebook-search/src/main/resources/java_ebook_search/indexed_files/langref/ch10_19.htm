Synopsis
Class Name:
java.lang.Short 
Superclass:
java.lang.Number 
Immediate Subclasses:
None 
Interfaces Implemented:
None 
Availability:
New as of JDK 1.1 
Description
The Short class provides an object wrapper for a short 
value. This is useful when you need to treat a short 
value as an object. For example, there are a number of utility methods 
that take a reference to an Object as one of their arguments. 
You cannot specify a short value for one of these arguments, 
but you can provide a reference to a Short object that 
encapsulates the byte value. Furthermore, the Short 
class is necessary as of JDK 1.1 to support the Reflection API
and class literals.
The Short class also provides a number of utility methods 
for converting short values to other primitive types 
and for converting short values to strings and vice-versa.

Constants
MAX_VALUE
public static final short MAX_VALUE= 32767
The largest value that can be represented by a short. 
MIN_VALUE
public static final byte MIN_VALUE= -32768
The smallest value that can be represented by a short. 
TYPE
public static final Class TYPE
The Class object that represents 
the primitive type short. 
It is always true that Short.TYPE 
== short.class.
Constructors
Short
public Short(short value)
Parameters
value
The short 
value to be encapsulated by this object. 
Description
Creates a Short object with the specified short 
value. 
public Short(String s) throws NumberFormatException
Parameters
s
The string to be made into a Short object. 
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the sequence of characters in the given String does 
not form a valid short literal. 
Description
Constructs a Short object with the value specified by 
the given string. 
The string should consist of one or more digit characters.
The digit characters can be preceded by a single `-'  character.
If the string contains any other characters, the constructor 
throws a NumberFormatException.
Class Methods
decode
public static Short decode(String nm) throws NumberFormatException
Parameters
nm
A String representation of the value to be 
encapsulated by a Short object. If the 
string begins with # or 
0x, it is a radix 16 representation of the value.  
If the string begins with 0, it is a radix 
8 representation of the value. Otherwise, it is assumed to be a 
radix 10 representation of the value.
Returns
A Short object that encapsulates the given value.
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String contains any non-digit characters 
other than a leading minus sign or the value represented by the 
String is less than Short.MIN_VALUE
or greater than Short.MAX_VALUE.
Description
This method returns a Short 
object that encapsulates the given value.
parseByte
   public static short parseShort(String s) throws NumberFormatException  
Parameters
s
The String 
to be converted to a short value. 
Returns
The numeric value of the short 
represented by the String object. 
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String does not contain a valid representation 
of a short or
the value represented by the 
String is less than Short.MIN_VALUE
or greater than Short.MAX_VALUE.
Description
This method returns the numeric value of the short 
represented by the contents of the given String object. 
The String must contain only decimal digits, except that 
the first character may be a minus sign. 
   public static short parseShort(String s, int radix) throws NumberFormatException  
Parameters
s
The String to be converted to a short value.
radix
The radix used in interpreting the characters in the String as
digits. This value must be in the range Character.MIN_RADIX to
Character.MAX_RADIX.  If radix is in the range 2 through 10, only
characters for which the Character.isDigit() method returns true are
considered to be valid digits. If radix is in the range 11 through 36,
characters in the ranges `A' through `Z' and
`a' through `z' are considered valid
digits.
Returns
The numeric value of the short 
represented by the String object in the specified radix. 
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String does not contain a valid representation 
of a short, radix is not in the appropriate range, or
the value represented by the 
String is less than Short.MIN_VALUE
or greater than Short.MAX_VALUE.
Description
This method returns the numeric value of the short 
represented by the contents of the given String object 
in the specified radix. The String must contain only 
valid digits of the specified radix, except that the first character may 
be a minus sign. The digits are parsed in the specified radix to produce 
the numeric value. 
toString
public String toString(short s)
Parameters
s
The short 
value to be converted to a string. 
Returns
The string representation of the given value. 
Description
This method returns a String object that contains the 
decimal representation of the given value.
This method returns a string that begins with `-' if the given 
value is negative. The rest of the string is a sequence of one or more 
of the characters `0', `1', `2', `3', 
`4', `5', `6', `7', `8', 
and `9'. This method returns "0" if its argument 
is 0. Otherwise, the string returned by this method does 
not begin with "0" or "-0". 
valueOf
public static Short valueOf(String s) throws NumberFormatException
Parameters
s
The string to be made 
into a Short object. 
Returns
The Short object constructed from the string. 
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String does not contain a valid representation 
of a short or
the value represented by the 
String is less than Short.MIN_VALUE
or greater than Short.MAX_VALUE.
Description
Constructs a Short object with the value specified by 
the given string. 
The string should consist of one or 
more digit characters. The digit characters can be preceded by a 
single `-'. If the string contains any other characters, the 
method throws a NumberFormatException.
   public static Short valueOf(String s, int radix) throws NumberFormatException  
Parameters
s
The string to be made into a Short object.
radix
The radix used in converting the string to 
a value. This value must be in the range Character.MIN_RADIX 
to Character.MAX_RADIX. 
Returns
The Short object constructed from the string. 
Throws
NumberFormatException
If the String does not contain a valid representation 
of a short, radix 
is not in the appropriate range, or 
the value represented by the 
String is less than Short.MIN_VALUE
or greater than Short.MAX_VALUE.
Description
Constructs a Short object with the value specified by 
the given string in the specified radix. 
The string should consist of one or more digit characters or 
characters in the range `A' to `Z' or `a' to `z' that are considered 
digits in the given radix. The digit characters can be preceded 
by a single `-' character. If the string contains any other 
characters, the method throws a NumberFormatException.
