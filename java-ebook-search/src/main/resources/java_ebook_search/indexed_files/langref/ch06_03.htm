6.3 The Empty Statement
The empty statement does nothing:
The empty statement can be useful as a place holder. For example, if
a for statement contains all of the necessary
functionality in its header, the body of the for
statement can be the empty statement. Here's an example:
// Find the first element of array nx that equals 5
int x;
for (x = 0; x &lt; nx.length &amp;&amp; nx[x] != 5; x++)
// for requires a statement here: use an empty statement
    ;
if (x &lt; nx.length) {
// The for statement found a 5 at nx[x]
}
