Description
The ThreadGroup class implements a grouping
scheme for threads. A ThreadGroup object can own
Thread objects and other
ThreadGroup objects. The ThreadGroup
class provides methods that allow a ThreadGroup
object to control its Thread and ThreadGroup
objects as a group. For example, suspend() and
resume() methods of a ThreadGroup
object call the suspend() and resume() methods of each of the Thread and ThreadGroup
objects that belong to the particular ThreadGroup.
When a Java program starts, a ThreadGroup object
is created to own the first Thread. Any additional
ThreadGroup objects are explicitly created by
the program.

Constructors
ThreadGroup
public ThreadGroup(String name)
Parameters
name
The name of this ThreadGroup
object.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a ThreadGroup object that has the
specified name and the same parent ThreadGroup
as the current thread.
public ThreadGroup(ThreadGroup parent, String name)
Parameters
parent
The ThreadGroup object that this
ThreadGroup object is to be added to.
name
The name of this ThreadGroup
object.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
Creates a ThreadGroup object with the specified
name and parent ThreadGroup object.
Instance Methods
activeCount
public int activeCount()
Returns
An approximation of the current number of threads in this
ThreadGroup object and any child ThreadGroup
objects.
Description
This method returns an approximation of the number of threads
that belong to this ThreadGroup object and any
child ThreadGroup objects. The count is approximate
because a thread can die after it is counted, but before the complete
count is returned. Also, after a child ThreadGroup
is counted but before the total count is returned, additional Thread
and ThreadGroup objects can be added to a child
ThreadGroup.
activeGroupCount
public int activeGroupCount()
Returns
An approximation of the current number of child ThreadGroup
objects in this ThreadGroup object.
Description
This method returns an approximation of the number of child
ThreadGroup objects that belong to this ThreadGroup
object. The count is approximate because after a child ThreadGroup
is counted but before the total count is returned, additional ThreadGroup
objects can be added to a child ThreadGroup.
allowThreadSuspension
public boolean allowThreadSuspension(boolean b)
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Parameters
b
A boolean value that specifies whether or not
the run-time system is allowed to suspend threads due to low memory.
Returns
The boolean value true.
Description
This method specifies whether or not the Java virtual machine is allowed
to suspend threads due to low memory.
checkAccess
public final void checkAccess()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method determines if the currently running thread has
permission to modify this ThreadGroup object.
destroy
public final void destroy()
Throws
IllegalThreadStateException
If this ThreadGroup object is
not empty, or if it has already been destroyed.
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method destroys this ThreadGroup object
and any child ThreadGroup objects. The ThreadGroup must not contain any Thread objects.
This method also removes the ThreadGroup object
from its parent ThreadGroup object.
enumerate
public int enumerate(Thread list[])
Parameters
list
A reference to an array of Thread
objects.
Returns
The number of Thread objects stored in
the array.
Description
This method stores a reference in the array for each of the
Thread objects that belongs to this ThreadGroup
or any of its child ThreadGroup objects.
If the array is not big enough to contain references to all
the Thread objects, only as many references as
will fit are put into the array. No indication is given that some
Thread objects were left out, so it is a good
idea to call activeCount() before calling this
method, to get an idea of how large to make the array.
public int enumerate(Thread list[], boolean recurse)
Parameters
list
A reference to an array of Thread
objects.
recurse
A boolean value that specifies
whether or not to include Thread objects that
belong to child ThreadGroup objects of this ThreadGroup
object.
Returns
The number of Thread objects stored in
the array.
Description
This method stores a reference in the array for each of the
Thread objects that belongs to this ThreadGroup
object. If recurse is true,
the method also stores a reference for each of the Thread
objects that belongs to a child ThreadGroup object
of this ThreadGroup.
If the array is not big enough to contain references to all
the Thread objects, only as many references as
will fit are put into the array. No indication is given that some
Thread objects were left out, so it is a good
idea to call activeCount() before calling this
method, to get an idea of how large to make the array.
public int enumerate(ThreadGroup list[])
Parameters
list
A reference to an array of ThreadGroup
objects.
Returns
The number of ThreadGroup objects stored
in the array.
Description
This method stores a reference in the array
for each ThreadGroup
object that belongs to this ThreadGroup
or any of its child ThreadGroup objects.
If the array is not big enough to contain references to all
the ThreadGroup objects, only as many references
as will fit are put into the array. No indication is given that
some ThreadGroup objects were left out, so it
is a good idea to call activeGroupCount() before
calling this method, to get an idea of how large to make the array.
public int enumerate(Thread list[], boolean recurse)
Parameters
list
A reference to an array of ThreadGroup
objects.
recurse
A boolean value that specifies
whether or not to include ThreadGroup objects
that belong to child ThreadGroup objects of this
ThreadGroup object.
Returns
The number of ThreadGroup objects stored
in the array.
Description
This method stores a reference in the array for each of the
ThreadGroup objects that belongs to this ThreadGroup
object. If recurse is true,
the method also stores a reference for each of the ThreadGroup
objects that belongs to a child ThreadGroup object
of this ThreadGroup.
If the array is not big enough to contain references to all
the ThreadGroup objects, only as many references
as will fit are put into the array. No indication is given that
some ThreadGroup objects were left out, so it
is a good idea to call activeGroupCount() before
calling this method, to get an idea of how large to make the array.
getMaxPriority
public final int getMaxPriority()
Returns
The maximum priority that can be assigned to Thread
objects that belong to this ThreadGroup object.
Description
This method returns the maximum priority that can be assigned
to Thread objects that belong to this ThreadGroup
object.
It is possible for a ThreadGroup to contain
Thread objects that have higher priorities than
this maximum, if they were given that higher priority before the
maximum was set to a lower value.
getName
public final String getName()
Returns
The name of this ThreadGroup object.
Description
This method returns the name of this ThreadGroup
object.
getParent
public final ThreadGroup getParent()
Returns
The parent ThreadGroup
object of this ThreadGroup, or null 
if this ThreadGroup
is the root of the thread group hierarchy.
Description
This method returns the parent
ThreadGroup object of this ThreadGroup
object. If this ThreadGroup is at the root of
the thread group hierarchy and has no parent, the method returns
null.
isDaemon
public final boolean isDaemon()
Returns
true if this ThreadGroup
is a daemon thread group; otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not this ThreadGroup
is a daemon thread group, based on the value of daemon
attribute of this ThreadGroup object. A daemon
thread group is destroyed when the last Thread
in it is stopped, or the last ThreadGroup in
it is destroyed.
isDestroyed
public synchronized boolean isDestroyed()
Availability
New as of JDK 1.1
Returns
true if this ThreadGroup
has been destroyed; otherwise false.
Description
This method determines whether or not this ThreadGroup
has been destroyed.

Description
This method outputs a listing of the contents of this ThreadGroup
object to System.out.
parentOf
public final boolean parentOf(ThreadGroup g)
Parameters
g
A ThreadGroup object.
Returns
true if this ThreadGroup
object is the same ThreadGroup, or a direct or indirect parent of
the specified ThreadGroup; otherwise false.

This method determines if this ThreadGroup
object is the same as the specified ThreadGroup
or one of its ancestors in the thread-group hierarchy.
resume
public final void resume()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method resumes each Thread object
that directly or indirectly belongs to this ThreadGroup
object by calling its resume() method.
setDaemon
public final void setDaemon(boolean daemon)
Parameters
daemon
The new value for this ThreadGroup
object's daemon attribute.
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method sets the daemon attribute
of this ThreadGroup object to the given value.
A daemon thread group is destroyed when the last Thread
in it is stopped, or the last ThreadGroup in
it is destroyed.
setMaxPriority
public final void setMaxPriority(int pri)
Parameters
pri
The new maximum priority for Thread objects
that belong to this ThreadGroup object.
Description
This method sets the maximum priority that can be assigned
to Thread objects that belong to this ThreadGroup
object.
It is possible for a ThreadGroup to contain
Thread objects that have higher priorities than
this maximum, if they were given that higher priority before the
maximum was set to a lower value.
stop
public final void stop()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description
This method stops each Thread object that
directly or indirectly belongs to this ThreadGroup
object by calling its stop() method.
suspend
public final void suspend()
Throws
SecurityException
If the checkAccess() method of
the SecurityManager throws a SecurityException.
Description

that directly or indirectly belongs to this ThreadGroup
object by calling its suspend() method.
toString
public String toString()
Returns
A string representation of this ThreadGroup
object.
Overrides
Object.toString()

object.
uncaughtException
public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e)
Parameters
t
A reference to a Thread that
just died because of an uncaught exception.
e
The uncaught exception.
Description
This method is called when a Thread object
that belongs to this ThreadGroup object dies
because of an uncaught exception. If this ThreadGroup
object has a parent ThreadGroup object, this
method just calls the parent's uncaughtException()
method. Otherwise, this method must determine whether the uncaught exception
is an instance of ThreadDeath. If it is, nothing
is done. If it is not, the method calls the printStackTrace()
method of the exception object.
If this method is overridden, the overriding method should
end with a call to super.uncaughtException().
