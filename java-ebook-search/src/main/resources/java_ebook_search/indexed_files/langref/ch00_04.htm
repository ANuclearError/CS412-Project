Preface
Online Resources
There are many sources for information about Java. Sun Microsystems's
official Web site for Java topics is
http://www.javasoft.com/. You
should look here for the latest news, updates, and Java releases. This
site is where you'll find the Java Development Kit ( JDK), which
includes the compiler, the interpreter, and other tools.
The various comp.lang.java.* newsgroups can be a
good source of
information about Java. The comp.lang.java.announce newsgroup is for
announcements that may be of interest to Java developers. The
comp.lang.java.programmer newsgroup is for
discussion of the Java
language; it's also a good place to ask intelligent questions.
There are a number of other Java newsgroups for various kinds of
specialized discussions. You should read the FAQ to find out more.
The FAQ is maintained on the Web at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/javafaq/javafaq.html.
You should also visit O'Reilly &amp; Associates' Java site on the Web at
http://www.ora.com/publishing/java. There you'll find
information about other books in O'Reilly's Java series.
