9.4 CheckboxGroup
The CheckboxGroup lets multiple 
checkboxes work together to provide a mutually exclusion choice (at most 
one Checkbox can be selected 
at a time). Because the CheckboxGroup 
is neither a Component nor a 
Container, you should normally 
put all the Checkbox components 
associated with a CheckboxGroup 
in their own Panel (or other 
Container). The LayoutManager 
of the Panel should be GridLayout 
(0, 1) if you want them in one column. Figure 9.5 shows both a good way and bad way of positioning 
a set of Checkbox items in 
a CheckboxGroup. The image 
on the left is preferred because the user can sense that the items are 
grouped; the image on the right suggests three levels of different checkboxes 
and can therefore surprise the user when checkboxes are deselected.

CheckboxGroup MethodsConstructors
public CheckboxGroup () 
This constructor creates an instance of CheckboxGroup. 
Miscellaneous methods
public int getSelectedCheckbox ()  public Checkbox getCurrent () 
The getSelectedCheckbox() method 
returns the Checkbox within 
the CheckboxGroup whose value 
is true. If no item is selected, 
null is returned. 
getCurrent() is the Java 1.0 
name for this method. 
public synchronized void setSelectedCheckbox (Checkbox checkbox)  public synchronized void setCurrent (Checkbox checkbox) 
The setSelectedCheckbox() method 
makes checkbox the currently 
selected Checkbox within the 
CheckboxGroup. If checkboxis null, 
the method deselects all the items in the CheckboxGroup. 
If checkbox is not within the 
CheckboxGroup, nothing happens. 
setCurrent() is the Java 1.0 
name for this method. 
public String toString () 
The toString() method of CheckboxGroup 
creates a String representation 
of the current choice (as returned by getSelectedCheckbox()). 
Using the "straightforward" layout in Figure 9.5 as an example, 
the results would be: 
java.awt.CheckboxGroup[current=java.awt.Checkbox[0,31,85x21,
    label=Helvetica,state=true]]
If there is no currently selected item, the results within the square brackets 
would be current=null.
