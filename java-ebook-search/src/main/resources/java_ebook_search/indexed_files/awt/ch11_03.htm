11.3 The Adjustable Interface
The Adjustable interface is 
new to Java 1.1. It provides the method signatures required for an object 
that lets you adjust a bounded integer value. It is currently implemented 
by Scrollbar and returned by 
two methods within ScrollPane. 
Constants of the Adjustable Interface
There are two direction specifiers for Adjustable. 
public final static int HORIZONTAL  
HORIZONTAL is the constant 
for horizontal orientation. 
public final static int VERTICAL  
VERTICAL is the constant for 
vertical orientation. 
Methods of the Adjustable Interface
public abstract int getOrientation ()  
The getOrientation() method 
is for returning the current orientation of the adjustable object, either 
Adjustable.HORIZONTAL or Adjustable.VERTICAL. 
setOrientation() is not part 
of the interface. Not all adjustable objects need to be able to alter orientation. 
For example, Scrollbar instances 
can change their orientation, but each Adjustable 
instance associated with a ScrollPane 
has a fixed, unchangeable orientation. 
public abstract int getVisibleAmount ()  
The getVisibleAmount() method 
lets you retrieve the size of the visible slider of the adjustable object. 
public abstract void setVisibleAmount (int amount)  
The setVisibleAmount() method 
lets you change the size of the visible slider to amount. 
public abstract int getValue ()  
The getValue() method lets 
you retrieve the current value of the adjustable object. 
public abstract void setValue (int value)  
The setValue() method lets 
you change the value of the adjustable object to value. 
public abstract int getMinimum () 
The getMinimum() method lets 
you retrieve the current minimum setting for the object. 
public abstract void setMinimum (int minimum)  
The setMinimum() method lets 
you change the minimum value of the adjustable object to minimum. 
public abstract int getMaximum ()  
The getMaximum() method lets 
you retrieve the current maximum setting for the object. 
public abstract void setMaximum (int maximum)  
The setMaximum() method lets 
you change the maximum value of the adjustable object to maximum. 
public abstract int getUnitIncrement ()  
The getUnitIncrement() method 
lets you retrieve the current line increment. 
public abstract void setUnitIncrement (int amount)  
The setUnitIncrement() method 
lets you change the line increment amount of the adjustable object to amount. 
public abstract int getBlockIncrement ()  
The getBlockIncrement() method 
lets you retrieve the current page increment. 
public abstract void setBlockIncrement (int amount)  
The setBlockIncrement() method 
lets you change the paging increment amount of the adjustable object to 
amount. 
public abstract void addAdjustmentListener(AdjustmentListener listener)  
The addAdjustmentListener() 
method lets you register listener 
as an object interested in being notified when an AdjustmentEvent 
passes through the EventQueue 
with this Adjustable object 
as its target. 
public abstract void removeAdjustmentListener(ItemListener listener)  
The removeAdjustmentListener() 
method removes listener as 
a interested listener. If listener 
is not registered, nothing happens.
