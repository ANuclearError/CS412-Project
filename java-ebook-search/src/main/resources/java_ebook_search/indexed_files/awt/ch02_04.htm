2.4 Shape
The new Shape interface defines 
a single method; it requires a geometric object to be able to report its 
bounding box. Currently, the Rectangle 
and Polygon classes implement 
Shape; one would expect other 
geometric classes to implement Shape 
in the future. Although Component 
has the single method defined by the Shape 
interface, it does not implement the interface. 
Shape Method
public abstract Rectangle getBounds()  
The getBounds() method returns 
the shape's bounding Rectangle. 
Once you have the bounding area, you can use methods like Graphics.copyArea() 
to copy the shape.
