Preface
Conventions Used in This Book
Italic is used for: 
Pathnames, filenames, and program names 
Internet addresses, such as domain names and URLs 
Typewriter Font is used for: 
Anything that might appear in a Java program, including keywords, method 
names, variables names, class names, and interface names 
Command lines and options that should be typed verbatim on the screen 
Tags that might appear in an HTML document 
To sort out the potential for confusion between different versions, I use 
the following dingbats throughout the book: 
Identifies a method, variable, or constant that is new 
in Java 1.1. 
Identifies a method from Java 1.0 that has been deprecated. Deprecated methods are available for compatibility but may disappear in a future release. These methods are tagged with the @deprecated flag, which causes the Java 1.1 compiler to display a warning message if you use them.
