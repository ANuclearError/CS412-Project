ContainerAdapter 
Name
ContainerAdapter 
Description
The ContainerAdapter class 
implements the methods of ContainerListener 
with empty functions. It may be easier for you to extend ContainerAdapter, 
overriding only those methods you are interested in, than to implement 
ContainerListener and provide 
the empty functions yourself.
