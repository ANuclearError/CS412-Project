2.3 Dimension
The Dimension class is similar 
to the Point class, except 
it encapsulates a width and height in a single object. Like Point, 
Dimension is somewhat underused; 
it is used primarily by methods that need to return a width and a height 
as a single object; for example, getSize() 
returns a Dimension object. 
Dimension MethodsVariables
A Dimension instance has two 
variables, one for width and one for height. They are accessible directly 
or through use of the getSize() method. 
public int width 
The width variable represents the size of an object along the x axis (left 
to right). Width should not be negative; however, there is nothing within 
the class to prevent this from happening. 
public int height 
The height variable represents the size of an object along the y axis (top 
to bottom). Height should not be negative; however, there is nothing within 
the class to prevent this from happening. 
Constructors
public Dimension () 
This constructor creates a Dimension 
instance with a width and height of 0. 
public Dimension (Dimension dim) 
This constructor creates a copy of dim. The initial width is dim.width. 
The initial height is dim.height. 
public Dimension (int width, int height) 
This constructor creates a Dimension 
with an initial width of width 
and an initial height of height. 
Sizing
public Dimension getSize ()  
The getSize() method retrieves 
the current size as a new Dimension, 
even though the instance variables are public. 
public void setSize (int width, int height)  
The setSize() method changes 
the dimension's size to width 
x height. 
public void setSize (Dimension d)  
The setSize() method changes 
the dimension's size to d.width 
x d.height. 
Miscellaneous methods
public boolean equals (Object object) 
The equals() method overrides the 
Object.equals() 
method to define equality for dimensions. Two Dimension 
objects are equal if their width and height values are equal. 
public String toString () 
The toString() method of Dimension 
returns a string showing the current width and height settings. For example: 
java.awt.Dimension[width=0,height=0]
Point
Shape
