Chapter 16Data Transfer
16.6 UnsupportedFlavorException
The UnsupportedFlavorException 
exception is thrown when you ask Transferable.getTransferData() 
to give you data in a flavor that isn't supported by the object on 
the clipboard. For example, if the clipboard currently holds an image and 
you ask for the data in the stringFlavor, 
you will almost certainly get an UnsupportedFlavorException 
because it is unlikely that an image object will be able to give you its 
data as a String. You can either 
ignore the exception or display an appropriate message to the user. 
UnsupportedFlavorException MethodConstructor
public UnsupportedFlavorException (DataFlavor flavor)
The sole constructor creates an UnsupportedFlavorException 
with a detail message containing the human presentable name of flavor. 
To retrieve this message, call getMessage(), 
which this exception inherits from the Exception 
superclass (and which is required by the Throwable 
interface).
