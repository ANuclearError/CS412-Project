4.2 The Event Class
An instance of the Event class 
is a platform-independent representation that encapsulates the specifics 
of an event that happens within the Java 1.0 model. It contains everything 
you need to know about an event: who, what, when, where, and why the event 
happened. Note that the Event 
class is not used in the Java 1.1 event model; instead, Java 1.1 has an 
AWTEvent class, with subclasses 
for different event types. 
When an event occurs, you decide whether or not to process the event. If 
you decide against reacting, the event passes through your program quickly 
without anything happening. If you decide to handle the event, you must 
deal with it quickly so the system can process the next event. If handling 
the event requires a lot of work, you should move the event-handling code 
into its own thread. That way, the system can process the next event while 
you go off and process the first. If you do not multithread your event 
processing, the system becomes slow and unresponsive and could lose events. 
A slow and unresponsive program frustrates users and may convince them 
to find another solution for their problems. 
Variables
Event contains ten instance 
variables that offer all the specific information for a particular event. Instance variables
public Object arg 
The arg field contains some 
data regarding the event, to be interpreted by the recipient. For example, 
if the user presses Return 
within a TextField, an Event 
with an id of ACTION_EVENT 
is generated with the TextField 
as the target and the string 
within it as the arg. See a 
description of each specific event to find out what its arg 
means. 
public int clickCount 
The clickCount field allows 
you to check for double clicking of the mouse. This field is relevant only 
for MOUSE_DOWN events. There 
is no way to specify the time delta used to determine how quick a double-click 
needs to be, nor is there a maximum value for clickCount. 
If a user quickly clicks the mouse four times, clickCount 
is four. Only the passage of a system-specific time delta will reset the 
value so that the next MOUSE_DOWN 
is the first click. The incrementing of clickCount 
does not care which mouse button is pressed. 
public Event evt 
The evt field does not appear 
to be used anywhere but is available if you wish to pass around a linked 
list of events. Then your program can handle this event and tell the system 
to deal with the next one (as demonstrated in the following code), or you can 
process the entire chain yourself. 
public boolean mouseDown (Event e, int x, int y) {
    System.out.println ("Coordinates: " + x + "-" + y);
    if (e.evt != null)
        postEvent (e.evt);
    return true;
}
public int id 
The id field of Event 
contains the identifier of the event. The system-generated events are the 
following Event constants:
WINDOW_DESTROY
MOUSE_ENTER
WINDOW_EXPOSE
MOUSE_EXIT
WINDOW_ICONIFY
MOUSE_DRAG
WINDOW_DEICONIFY
SCROLL_LINE_UP
KEY_PRESS
SCROLL_LINE_DOWN
KEY_RELEASE
SCROLL_PAGE_UP
KEY_ACTION
SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN
KEY_ACTION_RELEASE
SCROLL_ABSOLUTE
MOUSE_DOWN
LIST_SELECT
MOUSE_UP
LIST_DESELECT
MOUSE_MOVE
ACTION_EVENT
As a user, 
you can create your own event types and store your own unique event ID 
here. In Java 1.0, there is no formal way to prevent conflicts between your events and system events, but using a negative IO is a good ad-hoc method. It is up to you to check all the user events generated 
in your program in order to avoid conflicts among user events. 
public int key 
For keyboard-related events, the key 
field contains the integer representation of the keyboard element that 
caused the event. Constants are available for the keypad keys. To 
examine key as a character, 
just cast it to a char. For 
nonkeyboard-related events, the value is zero. 
pubic int modifiers 
The modifiers field shows the 
state of the modifier keys when the event happened. A flag is set for each 
modifier key pressed by the user when the event happened. Modifier keys 
are Shift, Control, Alt, and Meta. Since the middle and right mouse key 
are indicated in a Java event by a modifier key, one reason to use the 
modifiers field is to determine 
which mouse button triggered an event. See Working With Mouse Buttons in Java 1.0 
for an example. 
public Object target 
The target field contains a 
reference to the object that is the cause of the event. For example, if 
the user selects a button, the button is the target of the event. If the 
user moves the mouse into a Frame, 
the Frame is the target. The 
target indicates where the 
event happened, not the component that is dealing with it. 
public long when 
The when field contains the 
time of the event in milliseconds. The following code converts this
long value to a Date 
to examine its contents: 
Date d = new Date (e.when);
public int x public int y 
The x and y 
fields show the coordinates where the event happened. The coordinates are 
always relative to the top left corner of the target of the event and get 
translated based on the top left corner of the container as the event gets 
passed through the containing components. (See the previous Identifying the Target for an example 
of this translation.) It is possible for either or both of these to be 
outside the coordinate space of the applet (e.g., if user quickly moves 
the mouse outside the applet). 
Constants
Numerous constants are provided with the Event 
class. Several designate which event happened (the why). Others are available 
to help in determining the function key a user pressed (the what). And 
yet more are available to make your life easier. 
When the system generates an event, it calls a handler method for it. To 
deal with the event, you have to override the appropriate method. The different 
event type sections describe which methods you override. Key constants
These constants are set when a user presses a key. Most of them correspond 
to function and keypad keys; since such keys are generally used to invoke 
an action from the program or the system, Java calls them action 
keys and causes them to generate a 
different Event type (KEY_ACTION) 
from regular alphanumeric keys (KEY_PRESS). 
Table 4.2 shows the constants used to represent 
keys and the event type that uses each constant. The values, which are 
all declared public static final int, 
appear in the key variable 
of the event instance. A few keys represent ASCII characters that have 
string equivalents such as \n. 
Black stars () mark the constants that are new in Java 1.1; they can be used 
with the 1.0 event model, provided that you are running Java 1.1. Java 
1.1 events use a different set of key constants defined in the KeyEvent 
class.

Modifiers
Modifiers are keys like Shift, Control, Alt, or Meta. When a user presses 
any key or mouse button that generates an Event, 
the modifiers field of the 
Event instance is set. You 
can check whether any modifier key was pressed by ANDing its constant with 
the modifiers field. If multiple 
modifier keys were down at the time the event occurred, the constants for 
the different modifiers are ORed together in the field. 
public static final int ALT_MASK
public static final int CTRL_MASK
public static final int META_MASK
public static final int SHIFT_MASK
When reporting a mouse event, the system automatically sets the modifiers 
field. Since Java is advertised as supporting the single-button mouse model, 
all buttons generate the same mouse events, and the system uses the modifiers 
field to differentiate between mouse buttons. That way, a user with a one- 
or two-button mouse can simulate a three-button mouse by clicking on his 
mouse while holding down a modifier key. Table 4.3 
lists the mouse modifier keys; an applet in Working With Mouse Buttons in Java 1.0
demonstrates how to differentiate between mouse buttons. 
Table 4.3: Mouse Button Modifier Keys
Mouse Button
Modifier Key
Left mouse button
None
Middle mouse button
ALT_MASK
Right mouse button
META_MASK
For example, if you have a three-button mouse, and click the right button, 
Java generates some kind of mouse event with the META_MASK 
set in the modifiers 
field. If you have a one-button mouse, you can generate the same event 
by clicking the mouse while depressing the Meta key. 
NOTE: 
If you have a multibutton mouse and do an Alt+right 
mouse or Meta+left mouse, the results are platform specific. You should get a mouse event with two masks set.
Key events
The component peers deliver separate key events when a user presses and 
releases nearly any key. KEY_ACTION 
and KEY_ACTION_RELEASE are 
for the function and arrow keys, while KEY_PRESS 
and KEY_RELEASE are for the 
remaining control and alphanumeric keys. 
public static final int KEY_ACTION 
The peers deliver the KEY_ACTION 
event when the user presses a function or keypad key. The default Component.handleEvent() 
method calls the keyDown() 
method for this event. If the user holds down the key, this event is generated 
multiple times. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method KeyListener.keyPressed() 
handles this event. 
public static final int KEY_ACTION_RELEASE 
The peers deliver the KEY_ACTION_RELEASE 
event when the user releases a function or keypad key. The default handleEvent() 
method for Component calls 
the keyUp() method for this 
event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the KeyListener.keyReleased() 
interface method handles this event. 
public static final int KEY_PRESS 
The peers deliver the KEY_PRESS 
event when the user presses an ordinary key. The default Component.handleEvent() 
method calls the keyDown() 
method for this event. Holding down the key causes multiple KEY_PRESS 
events to be generated. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method KeyListener.keyPressed() 
handles this event. 
public static final int KEY_RELEASE 
The peers deliver KEY_RELEASE 
events when the user releases an ordinary key. The default handleEvent() 
method for Component calls 
the keyUp() method for this 
event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method KeyListener.keyReleased() 
 handles this event. 
NOTE: 
If you want to capture arrow and keypad keys under the X Window System, 
make sure the key codes are set up properly, using the xmodmap 
command. 
NOTE: 
Some platforms generate events for the modifier keys by themselves, 
whereas other platforms require modifier keys to be pressed with another 
key. For example, on a Windows 95 platform, if Ctrl+A is pressed, 
you would expect one KEY_PRESS 
and one KEY_RELEASE. However, 
there is a second KEY_RELEASE 
for the Control key. Under Motif, you get only a single KEY_RELEASE. 
Window events
Window events happen only for components that are children of Window. 
Several of these events are available only on certain platforms. Like other 
event types, the id variable 
holds the value of the specific event instance. 
public static final int WINDOW_DESTROY 
The peers deliver the WINDOW_DESTROY 
event whenever the system tells a window to destroy itself. This is usually 
done when the user selects the window manager's Close or Quit window 
menu option. By default, Frame instances 
do not deal with this event, and you must remember to catch it yourself. 
If you are using the 1.1 event model, the WindowListener.windowClosing() 
interface method handles this event.
public static final int WINDOW_EXPOSE 
The peers deliver the WINDOW_EXPOSE 
event whenever all or part of a window becomes visible. To find out what 
part of the window has become uncovered, use the getClipRect() method 
(or getClipBounds() in Java version 
1.1) of the Graphics parameter 
to the paint() method. If you 
are using the 1.1 event model, the WindowListener.windowOpening() 
interface method most closely corresponds to the handling of this event. 
public static final int WINDOW_ICONIFY 
The peers deliver the WINDOW_ICONIFY 
event when the user iconifies the window. If you are using the 1.1 event 
model, the interface method WindowListener.windowIconified() 
 handles this event. 
public static final int WINDOW_DEICONIFY 
The peers deliver the WINDOW_DEICONIFY 
event when the user de-iconifies the window. If you are using the 1.1 event 
model, the interface method WindowListener.windowDeiconified() 
handles this event. 
public static final int WINDOW_MOVED 
The WINDOW_MOVED event signifies 
that the user has moved the window. If you are using the 1.1 event model, 
the ComponentListener.componentMoved() 
interface method handles this event. 
Mouse events
The component peers deliver mouse events when a user presses or releases 
a mouse button. Events are also delivered whenever the mouse moves. In 
order to be platform independent, Java pretends that all mice have a single 
button. If you press the second or third button, Java generates a regular 
mouse event but sets the event's modifers 
field with a flag that indicates which button was pressed. If you press 
the left button, no modifiers 
flags are set. Pressing the center button sets the ALT_MASK 
flag; pressing the right button sets the META_MASK 
flag. Therefore, you can determine which mouse button was pressed by looking 
at the Event.modifiers attribute. 
Furthermore, users with a one-button or two-button mouse can generate the 
same events by pressing a mouse button while holding down the Alt or Meta 
keys. 
NOTE: 
Early releases of Java (1.0.2 and earlier) only propagated mouse events 
from Canvas and Container 
objects. With the 1.1 event model, the events that different components 
process are better defined. 
public static final int MOUSE_DOWN 
The peers deliver the MOUSE_DOWN 
event when the user presses any mouse button. This action must occur over 
a component that passes along the MOUSE_DOWN 
event. The default Component.handleEvent() 
method calls the mouseDown() 
method for this event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the MouseListener.mousePressed() 
interface method handles this event. 
public static final int MOUSE_UP 
The peers deliver the MOUSE_UP 
event when the user releases the mouse button. This action must occur over 
a component that passes along the MOUSE_UP 
event. The default handleEvent() 
method for Component calls 
the mouseUp() method for this 
event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method MouseListener.mouseReleased() 
 handles this event. 
public static final int MOUSE_MOVE 
The peers deliver the MOUSE_MOVE 
event whenever the user moves the mouse over any part of the applet. This 
can happen many, many times more than you want to track, so make sure you 
really want to do something with this event before trying to capture it. 
(You can also capture MOUSE_MOVE 
events and without losing much, choose to deal with only every third or fourth movement.) The default handleEvent() 
method calls the mouseMove() 
method for the event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method MouseMotionListener.mouseMoved() 
handles this event. 
public static final int MOUSE_DRAG 
The peers deliver the MOUSE_DRAG 
event whenever the user moves the mouse over any part of the applet with 
a mouse button depressed. The default method handleEvent() 
 calls the mouseDrag() 
method for the event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method MouseMotionListener.mouseDragged() 
 handles this event. 
public static final int MOUSE_ENTER 
The peers deliver the MOUSE_ENTER 
event whenever the cursor enters a component. The default handleEvent() 
method calls the mouseEnter() 
method for the event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method MouseListener.mouseEntered() 
 handles this event. 
public static final int MOUSE_EXIT 
The peers deliver the MOUSE_EXIT 
event whenever the cursor leaves a component. The default handleEvent() 
method calls the mouseExit() 
method for the event. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method MouseListener.mouseExited() 
 handles this event. 
Scrolling events
The peers deliver scrolling events for the Scrollbar 
component. The objects that have a built-in scrollbar (like List, 
ScrollPane, and TextArea) 
do not generate these events. No default methods are called for any of 
the scrolling events. They must be dealt with in the handleEvent() 
method of the Container or a subclass of the Scrollbar. You can determine 
which particular event occurred by checking the id 
variable of the event, and find out the new position of the thumb by looking 
at the arg variable or calling 
getValue() on the scrollbar. 
See also the description of the AdjustmentListener 
interface later in this chapter. 
public static final int SCROLL_LINE_UP 
The scrollbar peers deliver the SCROLL_LINE_UP 
event when the user presses the arrow pointing up for the vertical scrollbar 
or the arrow pointing left for the horizontal scrollbar. This decreases 
the scrollbar setting by one back toward the minimum value. If you are 
using the 1.1 event model, the interface method AdjustmentListener.adjustmentValueChanged()
 handles this event. 
public static final int SCROLL_LINE_DOWN 
The peers deliver the SCROLL_LINE_DOWN 
event when the user presses the arrow pointing down for the vertical scrollbar 
or the arrow pointing right for the horizontal scrollbar. This increases 
the scrollbar setting by one toward the maximum value. If you are using 
the 1.1 event model, the interface method AdjustmentListener.adjustmentValueChanged() 
 handles this event. 
public static final int SCROLL_PAGE_UP 
The peers deliver the SCROLL_PAGE_UP 
event when the user presses the mouse with the cursor in the area between the slider and 
the decrease arrow. This decreases the scrollbar setting by the paging 
increment, which defaults to 10, back toward the minimum value. If you 
are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method AdjustmentListener.adjustmentValueChanged() 
handles this event. 
public static final int SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN 
The peers deliver the SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN 
event when the user presses the mouse with the cursor in the area between the slider and 
the increase arrow. This increases the scrollbar setting by the paging 
increment, which defaults to 10, toward the maximum value. If you are 
using the 1.1 event model, the interface method AdjustmentListener.adjustmentValueChanged() 
 handles this event. 
public static final int SCROLL_ABSOLUTE 
The peers deliver the SCROLL_ABSOLUTE 
event when the user drags the slider part of the scrollbar. 
There is no set time period or distance between multiple SCROLL_ABSOLUTE 
events. If you are using the Java version 1.1 event model, the AdjustmentListener.adjustmentValueChanged() 
interface method handles this event. 
public static final int SCROLL_BEGIN  
The SCROLL_BEGIN event is not 
delivered by peers, but you may wish to use it to signify when a user drags 
the slider at the beginning of a series of SCROLL_ABSOLUTE 
events. SCROLL_END, described next, would 
then be used to signify the end of the series. 
public static final int SCROLL_END  
The SCROLL_END event is not 
delivered by peers, but you may wish to use it to signify when a user drags 
the slider at the end of a series of SCROLL_ABSOLUTE 
events. SCROLL_BEGIN, described previously,
would have been used to signify the beginning of the series. 
List events
Two events specific to the List 
class are passed along by the peers. They signify when the user has selected 
or deselected a specific choice in the List. 
It is not ordinarily necessary to capture these events, because the peers 
deliver the ACTION_EVENT when 
the user double-clicks on a specific item in the List 
and it is this ACTION_EVENT 
that triggers something to happen. However, if there is reason to do something 
when the user has just single-clicked on a choice, these events may be 
useful. An example of how they would prove useful is if you are displaying 
a list of filenames with the ability to preview files before loading. Single 
selection would preview, double-click would load, and deselect would stop 
previewing. 
No default methods are called for any of the list events. They must be 
dealt with in the handleEvent() 
method of the Container of 
the List or a subclass of the 
List. You can determine which 
particular event occurred by checking the id 
variable of the event. 
public static final int LIST_SELECT 
The peers deliver the LIST_SELECT 
event when the user selects an item in a List. 
If you are using the 1.1 event model, the interface method ItemListener.itemStateChanged() 
handles this event. 
public static final int LIST_DESELECT 
The peers deliver the LIST_DESELECT 
event when an item in a List 
has been deselected. This is generated only if the List 
permits multiple selections. If you are using the 1.1 event model, the 
ItemListener.itemStateChanged() 
interface method handles this event. 
Focus events
The peers deliver focus events when a component gains (GOT_FOCUS) 
or loses (LOST_FOCUS) the input 
focus. No default methods are called for the focus events. They must be 
dealt with in the handleEvent() 
method of the Container of 
the component or a subclass of the component. You can determine which particular 
event occurred by checking the id 
variable of the event. 
NOTE: 
Early releases of Java (1.0.2 and before) did not propagate focus 
events on all platforms. This is fixed in release 1.1 of Java. Still, 
you should avoid capturing focus events if you want to write portable 1.0 
code. 
public static final int GOT_FOCUS 
The peers deliver the GOT_FOCUS 
event when a component gets the input focus. If you are using the 1.1 event 
model, the FocusListener.focusGained() 
interface method handles this event. 
public static final int LOST_FOCUS 
The peers deliver the LOST_FOCUS 
event when a component loses the input focus. If you are using the 1.1 
event model, the FocusListener.focusLost() 
interface method handles this event. 
FileDialog events
The FileDialog events are another 
set of nonportable events. Ordinarily, the FileDialog 
events are completely dealt with by the system, and you never see them. 
Refer to Chapter 6, Containers for exactly how to work with the FileDialog 
object. If you decide to create a generic FileDialog 
object, you can use these events to indicate file loading and saving. These 
constants would be used in the id 
variable of the specific event instance: 
public static final int LOAD_FILE
public static final int SAVE_FILE
Miscellaneous events
ACTION_EVENT is probably the 
event you deal with most frequently. It is generated when the user performs 
the desired action for a specific component type (e.g., when a user selects 
a button or toggles a checkbox). This constant would be found in the id 
variable of the specific event instance.
public static final int ACTION_EVENT 
The circumstances that lead to the peers delivering the ACTION_EVENT 
event depend upon the component that is the target of the event and the 
user's platform. Although the event can be passed along differently 
on different platforms, users will be accustomed to how the peers work 
on their specific platforms and will not care that it is different on the 
other platforms. For example, a Java 1.0 List 
component on a Microsoft Windows platform allows the user to select an 
item by pressing the first letter of the choice, whereupon the List 
tries to find an item that starts with the letter. The X Window System 
List component does not provide 
this capability. It works like a normal X List, 
where the user must scroll to locate the item and then select it. 
When the ACTION_EVENT is generated, 
the arg variable of the specific 
Event instance is set based 
upon the component type. In Chapters 5-11, which describe Java's GUI components, the description of each component contains an "Events" subsection that describes the value of the event's arg field. If you are using the 
1.1 event model, the ActionListener.actionPerformed() 
and ItemListener.itemStateChanged() 
interface methods handle this event, depending upon the component type. 
Event MethodsConstructors
Ordinarily, the peers deliver all your events for you. However, if you are 
creating your own components or want to communicate across threads, it 
may be necessary to create your own events. You can also create your own 
events to notify your component's container of application-specific occurrences. 
For example, if you were implementing your own tab sequencing for text 
fields, you could create a "next text field" event to tell your container 
to move to the next text field. Once you create the event, you send it 
through the system using the Component.postEvent() 
method. 
public Event (Object target, long when, int id, int x, int y, int key, 
int modifiers, Object arg) 
The first version of the constructor is the most complete and is what the 
other two call. It initializes all the fields of the Event 
to the parameters passed and sets clickCount 
to 0. See the descriptions of the instance variables Variables 
for the meanings of the arguments. 
public Event (Object target, long when, int id, int x, int y, int key, 
int modifiers) 
The second constructor version calls the first with arg 
set to null. 
public Event (Object target, int id, Object arg) 
The final version calls the first constructor with the when, 
x, y, 
key, and modifiers 
parameters set to 0. 
Modifier methods
The modifier methods check to see if the different modifier mask values 
are set. They report the state of each modifier key at the moment an event 
occurred. It is possible for multiple masks to be set if multiple modifiers 
are pressed when the event occurs. 
There is no altDown() method; 
to check whether the Alt key is pressed you must directly compare the event's 
modifiers against the Event.ALT_MASK 
constant. The metaDown() method 
is helpful when dealing with mouse events to see if the user pressed the 
right mouse button. 
public boolean shiftDown () 
The shiftDown() method returns 
true if the Shift key was pressed and false otherwise. There is no way 
to differentiate left and right shift keys. 
public boolean controlDown () 
The controlDown() method returns 
true if the Control key was pressed and false otherwise. 
public boolean metaDown () 
The metaDown() method returns 
true if the Meta key was pressed and false otherwise. 
Miscellaneous methods
public void translate (int x, int y)
The translate() method translates 
the x and y coordinates of the Event 
instance by x and y. 
The system does this so that the coordinates of the event are relative 
to the component receiving the event, rather than the container of the 
component. The system takes care of all this for you when passing the event 
through the containment hierarchy (not the object hierarchy), so you do 
not have to bother with translating them yourself. Figure 4.3 
shows how this method would change the location of an event from a container 
down to an internal component. 
Figure 4.3: Translating an event's location relative to a component
protected String paramString () 
When you call the toString() 
method of Event, the paramString() 
method is called in turn to build the string to display. In the event you 
subclass Event to add additional 
information, instead of having to provide a whole new toString() 
method, you need only add the new information to the string already generated 
by paramString(). Assuming 
the new information is foo, this would result in the following 
method declaration: 
protected String paramString() {
    return super.paramString() + ",foo=" + foo;
}
public String toString () 
The toString() method of Event 
returns a string with numerous components. The only variables that will 
always be in the output will be the event ID and the x and y coordinates. 
The others will be present if necessary (i.e., non-null): key (as the integer 
corresponding to a keyboard event), shift when shiftDown() 
is true; control, when controlDown() 
is true; meta, when metaDown() 
is true; target (if it was a Component); 
and arg (the value depends on the target and ID). toString() 
does not display all pieces of the Event 
information. An event when moving a Scrollbar 
might result in the following: 
java.awt.Event[id=602,x=374,y=110,target=java.awt.Scrollbar[374,
110,15x50,val=1,vis=true,min=0,max=255,vert],arg=1]
Working With Mouse Buttons in Java 1.0
As stated earlier, the modifiers 
component of Event can be used 
to differentiate the different mouse buttons. If the user has a multibutton 
mouse, the modifiers field 
is set automatically to indicate which button was pressed. If the user 
does not own a multibutton mouse, he or she can press the mouse button 
in combination with the Alt or Meta keys to simulate a three-button mouse. 
Example 4.2 is a sample program called mouseEvent 
that displays the mouse button selected.

        g.drawString (theString, 20, 20);
    }
    public boolean mouseDown (Event e, int x, int y) {
        if (e.modifiers == Event.META_MASK) {
            setString ("Right Button Pressed");
        } else if (e.modifiers == Event.ALT_MASK) {
            setString ("Middle Button Pressed");
        } else {
            setString ("Left Button Pressed");
        }
        repaint ();
        return true;
    }
    public boolean mouseUp (Event e, int x, int y) {
        setString ("Press a Mouse Key");
        repaint ();
        return true;
    }
}
Unfortunately, this technique does not always work. With certain components 
on some platforms, the peer captures the mouse event and does not pass 
it along; for example, on Windows, the display-edit menu of a TextField appears when you select the right mouse button. 
Be cautious about relying on multiple mouse buttons; better yet, if you 
want to ensure absolute portability, stick to a single button. 
Comprehensive Event List
Unfortunately, there are many platform-specific differences in the way 
event handling works. It's not clear whether these differences are 
bugs or whether vendors think they are somehow improving their product by introducing 
portability problems. We hope that as Java matures, different platforms 
will gradually come into synch. Until that happens, you might want your 
programs to assume the lowest common denominator. If you are willing to 
take the risk, you can program for a specific browser or platform, but 
should be aware of the possibility of changes. 
Appendix C, Platform-Specific Event Handling, includes a table that shows which components pass along which 
events by default in the most popular environments. This table was developed 
using an interactive program called compList, 
which generates a list of supported events for each component. You can 
find compList on this book's 
Web site, http://www.ora.com/catalog/javawt. 
If you want to check the behavior of some new platform, or a newer version 
of one of the platforms in Appendix C, Platform-Specific Event Handling, feel free to use compList. 
It does require a little bit of work on your part. You have to click, toggle, 
type, and mouse over every object. Hopefully, as Java matures, this program 
will become unnecessary.
