14.2 AudioClip Interface
Once an audio file is loaded into memory with getAudioClip(), 
you use the AudioClip interface 
to work with it. Methods
Three methods define the AudioClip 
interface. The class that implements these methods depends on the run-time 
environment; the class is probably sun.applet.AppletAudioClip 
or netscape.applet.AppletAudioClip. 
If you play an audio clip anywhere within your Applet, 
you should call the AudioClip 
stop() method within the stop() 
method of the applet. This ensures that the audio file will stop playing 
when the user leaves your web page. Stopping audio clips is a must if you 
call loop() to play the sound 
continuously; if you don't stop an audio clip, the user will have to exit the browser 
to get the sound to stop playing. 
Applets can play audio clips simultaneously. Based upon the user's actions, you may want to play a sound 
file in the background continuously, while playing other files.
void play () 
The play() method plays the 
audio clip once from the beginning. 
void loop () 
The loop() method plays the 
audio clip continuously. When it gets to the end-of-file marker, it resets 
itself to the beginning. 
void stop () 
The stop() method stops the 
applet from playing the audio clip. 
Using an AudioClip
The applet in Example 14.2 loads three audio files in the init() 
method. The start() method 
plays Dino barking in the background as a continuous loop. Whenever the 
browser calls paint(), Fred 
yells "Wilma," and when you click the mouse anywhere, the call 
to mouseDown() plays Fred yelling, 
"Yabba-Dabba-Doo." If you try real hard, all three can play 
at once. Before playing any audio clip, the applet makes sure that the 
clip is not null--that is, that the clip loaded correctly. stop() 
stops all clips from playing; you should make sure that applets stop all 
audio clips before the viewer leaves the web page. 
Example 14.2: AudioClip Usage
import java.net.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.applet.*;
public class AudioTestExample extends Applet{
    AudioClip audio1, audio2, audio3;
    public void init () {
        audio1 = getAudioClip (getCodeBase(), "audio/flintstones.au");
        audio2 = getAudioClip (getCodeBase(), "audio/dino.au");
        audio3 = getAudioClip (getCodeBase(), "audio/wilma.au");
    }
    public boolean mouseDown (Event e, int x, int y) {
        if (audio1 != null)
            audio1.play();
        return true;
    }
    public void start () {
        if (audio2 != null)
            audio2.loop();
    }
    public void paint (Graphics g) {
        if (audio3 != null)
            audio3.play();
    }
    public void stop () {
        if (audio1 != null)
            audio1.stop();
        if (audio2 != null)
            audio2.stop();
        if (audio3 != null)
            audio3.stop();
    }
}
