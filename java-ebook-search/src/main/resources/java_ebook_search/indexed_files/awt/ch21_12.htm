FocusEvent 
Name
FocusEvent 
Description
Focus events are generated when a component gets or loses input focus. 
Focus events come in two flavors, permanent and temporary. Permanent focus 
events occur with explicit focus changes. For example, when the user tabs 
through components, this causes permanent focus events. An example of a 
temporary focus event is when a component loses focus as its containing 
window is deactivated.
