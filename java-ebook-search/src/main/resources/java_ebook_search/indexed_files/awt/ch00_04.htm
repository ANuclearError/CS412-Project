Preface
Other Java Books and Resources
This book is part of a series of Java books from O'Reilly &amp; Associates 
that covers everything you wanted to know, and then some. The Java 
AWT Reference is paired with the Java 
Fundamental Class Reference to document 
the entire Core Java API. Other books in the series provide an introduction 
(Exploring Java) 
and document the virtual machine (Java Virtual Machine), 
the language (Java Language Reference), 
multithreaded programming (Java Threads), 
and network programming (Java Network Programming), 
with more to come. Java in a Nutshell is 
another popular Java book in the Nutshell series from O'Reilly. For 
a complete up-to-date list of the available Java resources, refer to 
http://www.ora.com/info/java/. 
In addition to the resources from O'Reilly, Sun's online
documentation on Java is maintained at
http://www.javasoft.com/nav/download/index.html.
Information on specific Java-capable browsers can be found at their
respective Web sites, which are listed in Table 0.1. 
More are sure to be on the way. (Some
browsers are platform specific, while others are multi-platform.)

Newsgroups also serve as a discussion area for Java-related topics. The 
comp.lang.java 
group has formally split into several others. The new groups are:
comp.lang.java.advocacy
comp.lang.java.machine
comp.lang.java.announce
comp.lang.java.programmer
comp.lang.java.beans
comp.lang.java.security
comp.lang.java.databases
comp.lang.java.setup
comp.lang.java.gui
comp.lang.java.softwaretools
comp.lang.java.help
comp.lang.java.tech
For folks without time to dig through all the noise, Digital 
Espresso provides a periodic digest 
of the newsfeed at http://www.io.org./~mentor/DigitalEspresso.html. 
A list of 
Java FAQs is at http://www-net.com/java/faq/; 
one of the most interesting is Cafe Au Lait, 
at http://sunsite.unc.edu/javafaq/. 
(Cafe Au Lait is 
written by Elliotte Rusty Harold, author of Java Network 
Programming.) 
Local Java user groups are another good resource. (Having founded one myself, 
I'm biased.) What they offer varies greatly, but unless you look 
at one, you are potentially leaving out a vast resource for knowledge and 
experience. Lists of area user groups are available from JavaSoft at 
http://www.javasoft.com/Mail/usrgrp.html; 
also check out the Sun User Group's Special Interest Group for Users 
of Java at http://www.sug.org/Java/groups.html. 
In addition to the usual monthly meetings and forums, some maintain a mailing 
list for technical exchanges. 
Security is a major issue with Java. If you are interested in reading more 
about Java security issues, Princeton University's Safe Internet 
Programming Web site at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/News.html 
is an excellent resource.
